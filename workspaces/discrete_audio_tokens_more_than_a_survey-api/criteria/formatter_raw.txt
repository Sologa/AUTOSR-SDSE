    "title": "Discrete Audio Tokens: More Than a Survey!",
    "definition": "Discrete audio/speech tokens are discrete, compact, symbol-like units produced by encoding and quantizing a continuous audio (especially speech) waveform into a sequence of symbols from a finite vocabulary, enabling storage/transmission efficiency and seamless integration with language-model-style sequence modeling for audio reconstruction, generation, understanding, and cross-/multi-modal modeling. The scope includes both acoustic tokens (focused on reconstruction/compression) and semantic tokens (focused on linguistic/semantic abstraction), and considers tokenization methods, quantization strategies, sequence-length reduction, variable-rate tokenization, streaming/latency concerns, and evaluation across reconstruction quality, bitrate/information density, and downstream task performance.",
