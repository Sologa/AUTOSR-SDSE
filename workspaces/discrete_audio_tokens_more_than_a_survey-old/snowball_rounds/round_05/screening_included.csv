10.21437/interspeech.2021-1503,Speech Representation Learning Combining Conformer CPC with Deep Cluster for the ZeroSpeech Challenge 2021,"We present a system for the Zero Resource Speech Challenge 2021, which combines a Contrastive Predictive Coding (CPC) with deep cluster. In deep cluster, we first prepare pseudo-labels obtained by clustering the outputs of a CPC network with k-means. Then, we train an additional autoregressive model to classify the previously obtained pseudo-labels in a supervised manner. Phoneme discriminative representation is achieved by executing the second-round clustering with the outputs of the final layer of the autoregressive model. We show that replacing a Transformer layer with a Conformer layer leads to a further gain in a lexical metric. Experimental results show that a relative improvement of 35% in a phonetic metric, 1.5% in the lexical metric, and 2.3% in a syntactic metric are achieved compared to a baseline method of CPC-small which is trained on LibriSpeech 460h data. We achieve top results in this challenge with the syntactic metric.",1,,include (senior:4),,,2021,,,"{""title"": ""Speech Representation Learning Combining Conformer CPC with Deep Cluster for the ZeroSpeech Challenge 2021"", ""summary"": ""We present a system for the Zero Resource Speech Challenge 2021, which combines a Contrastive Predictive Coding (CPC) with deep cluster.

10.1109/icassp48485.2024.10445804,Promptvc: Flexible Stylistic Voice Conversion in Latent Space Driven by Natural Language Prompts,"Stylistic voice conversion aims to transform the style of source speech to a desired style according to real-world application demands. However, the current style voice conversion approach relies on pre-defined labels or reference speech to control the conversion process, which leads to limitations in style diversity or falls short in terms of the intuitive and interpretability of style representation. In this study, we propose PromptVC, a novel style voice conversion approach that employs a latent diffusion model to generate a style vector driven by natural language prompts. Specifically, the style vector is extracted by a style encoder during training, and then the latent diffusion model is trained independently to sample the style vector from noise, with this process being conditioned on natural language prompts. To improve style expressiveness, we leverage HuBERT to extract discrete tokens and replace them with the K-Means center embedding to serve as the linguistic content, which minimizes residual style information. Additionally, we deduplicate the same discrete token and employ a differentiable duration predictor to re-predict the duration of each token, which can adapt the duration of the same linguistic content to different styles. The subjective and objective evaluation results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed system.",1,,include (senior:4),,,2024,,,"{""title"": ""Promptvc: Flexible Stylistic Voice Conversion in Latent Space Driven by Natural Language Prompts"", ""summary"": ""Stylistic voice conversion aims to transform the style of source speech to a desired style according to real-world application demands.

10.21437/interspeech.2021-1664,Unsupervised Acoustic Unit Discovery by Leveraging a Language-Independent Subword Discriminative Feature Representation,"This paper tackles automatically discovering phone-like acoustic units (AUD) from unlabeled speech data. Past studies usually proposed single-step approaches. We propose a two-stage approach: the first stage learns a subword-discriminative feature representation and the second stage applies clustering to the learned representation and obtains phone-like clusters as the discovered acoustic units. In the first stage, a recently proposed method in the task of unsupervised subword modeling is improved by replacing a monolingual out-of-domain (OOD) ASR system with a multilingual one to create a subword-discriminative representation that is more language-independent. In the second stage, segment-level k-means is adopted, and two methods to represent the variable-length speech segments as fixed-dimension feature vectors are compared. Experiments on a very low-resource Mboshi language corpus show that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art AUD in both normalized mutual information (NMI) and F-score. The multilingual ASR improved upon the monolingual ASR in providing OOD phone labels and in estimating the phone boundaries. A comparison of our systems with and without knowing the ground-truth phone boundaries showed a 16% NMI performance gap, suggesting that the current approach can significantly benefit from improved phone boundary estimation.",1,,include (senior:4),,,2021,,,"{""title"": ""Unsupervised Acoustic Unit Discovery by Leveraging a Language-Independent Subword Discriminative Feature Representation"", ""summary"": ""This paper tackles automatically discovering phone-like acoustic units (AUD) from unlabeled speech data.

The speech signals are transformed into a sequence of acoustic subword units or virtual phones which are discovered automatically from the given speech signals in an unsupervised manner. The speech signal is initially segmented into acoustically homogeneous segments through kernel-Gram segmentation using MFCC and autoencoder bottleneck features.

The virtual phones for the utterances to be resynthesized are encoded as one-hot vector sequences. Deep neural network based duration model and acoustic model are trained for synthesis using these sequences. A vocoder is used to synthesize speech in target speaker's voice from the features estimated by the acoustic model.
