10.48550/arxiv.2206.11706,A Temporal Extension of Latent Dirichlet Allocation for Unsupervised Acoustic Unit Discovery,"Latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) is widely used for unsupervised topic modelling on sets of documents. No temporal information is used in the model. However, there is often a relationship between the corresponding topics of consecutive tokens. In this paper, we present an extension to LDA that uses a Markov chain to model temporal information. We use this new model for acoustic unit discovery from speech. As input tokens, the model takes a discretised encoding of speech from a vector quantised (VQ) neural network with 512 codes. The goal is then to map these 512 VQ codes to 50 phone-like units (topics) in order to more closely resemble true phones. In contrast to the base LDA, which only considers how VQ codes co-occur within utterances (documents), the Markov chain LDA additionally captures how consecutive codes follow one another. This extension leads to an increase in cluster quality and phone segmentation results compared to the base LDA.

10.48550/arxiv.2212.09058,BEATs: Audio Pre-Training with Acoustic Tokenizers,"The massive growth of self-supervised learning (SSL) has been witnessed in language, vision, speech, and audio domains over the past few years. While discrete label prediction is widely adopted for other modalities, the state-of-the-art audio SSL models still employ reconstruction loss for pre-training. Compared with reconstruction loss, semantic-rich discrete label prediction encourages the SSL model to abstract the high-level audio semantics and discard the redundant details as in human perception. However, a semantic-rich acoustic tokenizer for general audio pre-training is usually not straightforward to obtain, due to the continuous property of audio and unavailable phoneme sequences like speech. To tackle this challenge, we propose BEATs, an iterative audio pre-training framework to learn Bidirectional Encoder representation from Audio Transformers, where an acoustic tokenizer and an audio SSL model are optimized by iterations. In the first iteration, we use random projection as the acoustic tokenizer to train an audio SSL model in a mask and label prediction manner. Then, we train an acoustic tokenizer for the next iteration by distilling the semantic knowledge from the pre-trained or fine-tuned audio SSL model. The iteration is repeated with the hope of mutual promotion of the acoustic tokenizer and audio SSL model. The experimental results demonstrate our acoustic tokenizers can generate discrete labels with rich audio semantics and our audio SSL models achieve state-of-the-art results across various audio classification benchmarks, even outperforming previous models that use more training data and model parameters significantly.

Second, during finetuning we propose a Transformer-based code predictor to accurately predict clean codes by modeling the global dependency of input noisy representations, which enables discovery and restoration of high-quality clean representations with reduced distortions. Furthermore, we propose an interactive feature fusion network to combine original noisy and the restored clean representations to consider both fidelity and quality, resulting in more informative features for downstream ASR.

10.48550/arxiv.2306.10521,LM-VC: Zero-shot Voice Conversion via Speech Generation based on Language Models,"Language model (LM) based audio generation frameworks, e.g., AudioLM, have recently achieved new state-of-the-art performance in zero-shot audio generation. In this paper, we explore the feasibility of LMs for zero-shot voice conversion. An intuitive approach is to follow AudioLM - Tokenizing speech into semantic and acoustic tokens respectively by HuBERT and SoundStream, and converting source semantic tokens to target acoustic tokens conditioned on acoustic tokens of the target speaker. However, such an approach encounters several issues: 1) the linguistic content contained in semantic tokens may get dispersed during multi-layer modeling while the lengthy speech input in the voice conversion task makes contextual learning even harder; 2) the semantic tokens still contain speaker-related information, which may be leaked to the target speech, lowering the target speaker similarity; 3) the generation diversity in the sampling of the LM can lead to unexpected outcomes during inference, leading to unnatural pronunciation and speech quality degradation. To mitigate these problems, we propose LM-VC, a two-stage language modeling approach that generates coarse acoustic tokens for recovering the source linguistic content and target speaker's timbre, and then reconstructs the fine for acoustic details as converted speech.

In this paper, we explore the feasibility of LMs for zero-shot voice conversion. An intuitive approach is to follow AudioLM - Tokenizing speech into semantic and acoustic tokens respectively by HuBERT and SoundStream, and converting source semantic tokens to target acoustic tokens conditioned on acoustic tokens of the target speaker. However, such an approach encounters several issues: 1) the linguistic content contained in semantic tokens may get dispersed during multi-layer modeling while the lengthy speech input in the voice conversion task makes contextual learning even harder; 2) the semantic tokens still contain speaker-related information, which may be leaked to the target speech, lowering the target speaker similarity; 3) the generation diversity in the sampling of the LM can lead to unexpected outcomes during inference, leading to unnatural pronunciation and speech quality degradation. To mitigate these problems, we propose LM-VC, a two-stage language modeling approach that generates coarse acoustic tokens for recovering the source linguistic content and target speaker's timbre, and then reconstructs the fine for acoustic details as converted speech. Specifically, to enhance content preservation and facilitates better disentanglement, a masked prefix LM with a mask prediction strategy is used for coarse acoustic modeling.

Specifically, we introduce finite-scalar quantization to improve the codebook utilization of speech tokens. For the text-speech LM, we streamline the model architecture to allow direct use of a pre-trained LLM as the backbone. In addition, we develop a chunk-aware causal flow matching model to support various synthesis scenarios, enabling both streaming and non-streaming synthesis within a single model. By training on a large-scale multilingual dataset, CosyVoice 2 achieves human-parity naturalness, minimal response latency, and virtually lossless synthesis quality in the streaming mode.

10.48550/arxiv.2505.24496,Speech Token Prediction via Compressed-to-fine Language Modeling for Speech Generation,"Neural audio codecs, used as speech tokenizers, have demonstrated remarkable potential in the field of speech generation. However, to ensure high-fidelity audio reconstruction, neural audio codecs typically encode audio into long sequences of speech tokens, posing a significant challenge for downstream language models in long-context modeling. We observe that speech token sequences exhibit short-range dependency: due to the monotonic alignment between text and speech in text-to-speech (TTS) tasks, the prediction of the current token primarily relies on its local context, while long-range tokens contribute less to the current token prediction and often contain redundant information. Inspired by this observation, we propose a \textbf{compressed-to-fine language modeling} approach to address the challenge of long sequence speech tokens within neural codec language models: (1) \textbf{Fine-grained Initial and Short-range Information}: Our approach retains the prompt and local tokens during prediction to ensure text alignment and the integrity of paralinguistic information; (2) \textbf{Compressed Long-range Context}: Our approach compresses long-range token spans into compact representations to reduce redundant information while preserving essential semantics.
