Recent generative approaches based on language models rely on text prompts as conditions. However, fine nuances in musical audio samples can hardly be described in the modality of text. For addressing this shortcoming, we propose to learn a highly descriptive latent 2D audio map by a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) which is then utilized for conditioning a Transformer model. We demonstrate the Transformer model's ability to achieve high generation quality and compare its performance against two baseline models. By selecting points on the map that compresses the manifold of the audio training set into 2D, we enable a more natural interaction with the model. We showcase this capability through an interactive demo interface, which is accessible on our website https://limchr.github.io/gesam/","['https://openalex.org/W4318351475', 'https://openalex.org/W4297677272', 'https://openalex.org/W2775487773', 'https://openalex.org/W4309117899', 'https://openalex.org/W3160235471', 'https://openalex.org/W3123097577', 'https://openalex.org/W4380136719', 'https://openalex.org/W4372260516', 'https://openalex.org/W4287271111', 'https://openalex.org/W4301206121', 'https://openalex.org/W4303519914', 'https://openalex.org/W3099378280', 'https://openalex.org/W4311415873', 'https://openalex.org/W4300980117', 'https://openalex.org/W4372341951', 'https://openalex.org/W3136272958', 'https://openalex.org/W3015287975', 'https://openalex.org/W4205137627', 'https://openalex.org/W3093209529', 'https://openalex.org/W2519091744', 'https://openalex.org/W2948211236', 'https://openalex.org/W4372263311', 'https://openalex.org/W4306177919', 'https://openalex.org/W4367359628', 'https://openalex.org/W4297632254', 'https://openalex.org/W4390784372', 'https://openalex.org/W4383646190', 'https://openalex.org/W3099425575', 'https://openalex.org/W2913668833']",2024-05-30

We introduce BeatNet+, a two-stage approach to real-time rhythm analysis built on a previous state-of-the-art method named BeatNet. The main innovation of the proposed method is the auxiliary training strategy that helps the neural network model to learn a representation invariant to the amount of percussive components in the music. Together with other architectural improvements, this strategy significantly improves the model performance for generic music. Another innovation is on the adaptation strategies that help develop real-time rhythm analysis models for challenging music scenarios, including isolated singing voices and non-percussive music. Two adaptation strategies are proposed and experimented with using different neural architectures and training schemes. Comprehensive experiments and comparisons with multiple baselines are conducted, and results show that BeatNet+ achieves superior beat tracking and downbeat tracking F1 scores for generic music, isolated singing voices, and non-percussive audio, with competitive latency and computational complexity. Finally, we release beat and downbeat annotations for two datasets that are designed for other tasks, and revised annotations of three existing datasets. We also release the code repository and pre-trained models on GitHub.","['https://openalex.org/W2895012458', 'https://openalex.org/W2909193097', 'https://openalex.org/W3118825798', 'https://openalex.org/W2402118560', 'https://openalex.org/W2572771584', 'https://openalex.org/W2350911425', 'https://openalex.org/W4390438133', 'https://openalex.org/W3203140070', 'https://openalex.org/W3209984917', 'https://openalex.org/W4385152046', 'https://openalex.org/W3170942659', 'https://openalex.org/W2984379537', 'https://openalex.org/W2160484251', 'https://openalex.org/W3213726885', 'https://openalex.org/W4280498166', 'https://openalex.org/W2555634470', 'https://openalex.org/W2980581183', 'https://openalex.org/W2168300772', 'https://openalex.org/W2773636018', 'https://openalex.org/W2214015592', 'https://openalex.org/W2114640443', 'https://openalex.org/W1519655822', 'https://openalex.org/W1980674027', 'https://openalex.org/W2117330939', 'https://openalex.org/W2156063659', 'https://openalex.org/W3192245760', 'https://openalex.org/W3097162551', 'https://openalex.org/W4293849742', 'https://openalex.org/W3208932618', 'https://openalex.org/W4372260188', 'https://openalex.org/W2016885049', 'https://openalex.org/W4224918587', 'https://openalex.org/W3034573343', 'https://openalex.org/W2463507112', 'https://openalex.org/W2404509795', 'https://openalex.org/W2404298818', 'https://openalex.org/W3217401639', 'https://openalex.org/W3207444892', 'https://openalex.org/W2962750090', 'https://openalex.org/W75292264', 'https://openalex.org/W2103412706', 'https://openalex.org/W3203405879', 'https://openalex.org/W3007433671', 'https://openalex.org/W2133824856', 'https://openalex.org/W4306177919', 'https://openalex.org/W4297847268', 'https://openalex.org/W2359732680', 'https://openalex.org/W3172640350']",2024-01-01
https://openalex.org/W4390738640,https://doi.org/10.1109/taslp.2024.3352248,Self-Supervised Audio Teacher-Student Transformer for Both Clip-Level and Frame-Level Tasks,"Self-supervised learning (SSL) has emerged as a popular approach for learning audio representations. One goal of audio self-supervised pre-training is to transfer knowledge to downstream audio tasks, generally including clip-level and frame-level tasks. While frame-level tasks are important for fine-grained acoustic scene/event understanding, prior studies primarily evaluate on clip-level downstream tasks. In order to tackle both clip-level and frame-level tasks, this paper proposes Audio Teacher-Student Transformer (ATST), with a clip-level version (named ATST-Clip) and a frame-level version (named ATST-Frame), responsible for learning clip-level and frame-level representations, respectively. Both methods use a Transformer encoder and a teacher-student training scheme. We have carefully designed a view creation strategy for ATST-Clip and ATST-Frame. Specifically, ATST-Clip uses segment-wise data augmentations, and ATST-Frame integrates frame-wise data augmentations and masking. Experimental results show that our ATST-Frame model obtains state-of-the-art (SOTA) performances on most of the clip-level and frame-level downstream tasks. Especially, it outperforms other models by a large margin on the frame-level sound event detection task. In addition, the performance can be further improved by combining the two models through knowledge distillation.","['https://openalex.org/W6844194202', 'https://openalex.org/W3015949486', 'https://openalex.org/W3162391496', 'https://openalex.org/W3137857706', 'https://openalex.org/W3201143670', 'https://openalex.org/W3206996142', 'https://openalex.org/W4297841853', 'https://openalex.org/W3205550549', 'https://openalex.org/W6840200333', 'https://openalex.org/W6848208918', 'https://openalex.org/W4311137818', 'https://openalex.org/W4310873011', 'https://openalex.org/W2896457183', 'https://openalex.org/W4385245566', 'https://openalex.org/W6810510949', 'https://openalex.org/W4372341324', 'https://openalex.org/W4297841518', 'https://openalex.org/W2593116425', 'https://openalex.org/W3171007011', 'https://openalex.org/W2982223350', 'https://openalex.org/W6780218876', 'https://openalex.org/W3209059054', 'https://openalex.org/W3041561163', 'https://openalex.org/W6810007534', 'https://openalex.org/W3196974791', 'https://openalex.org/W4375869340', 'https://openalex.org/W4313156423', 'https://openalex.org/W6784333009', 'https://openalex.org/W2963542740', 'https://openalex.org/W6745930336', 'https://openalex.org/W6745136726', 'https://openalex.org/W4246193833', 'https://openalex.org/W3159481202', 'https://openalex.org/W6846935845', 'https://openalex.org/W6638523607', 'https://openalex.org/W6809596386', 'https://openalex.org/W3205743929', 'https://openalex.org/W6757817989', 'https://openalex.org/W6726497184', 'https://openalex.org/W2038484192', 'https://openalex.org/W6750665317', 'https://openalex.org/W2726515241', 'https://openalex.org/W6736723571', 'https://openalex.org/W4205689591', 'https://openalex.org/W6796761347', 'https://openalex.org/W2959539607', 'https://openalex.org/W3162999565', 'https://openalex.org/W3015190346', 'https://openalex.org/W2526050071', 'https://openalex.org/W2982343573', 'https://openalex.org/W3006926732', 'https://openalex.org/W4225713393', 'https://openalex.org/W3094550259', 'https://openalex.org/W2973157397', 'https://openalex.org/W4226442948', 'https://openalex.org/W3205475937', 'https://openalex.org/W1494198834', 'https://openalex.org/W6809947431', 'https://openalex.org/W4285483774', 'https://openalex.org/W4297808394', 'https://openalex.org/W4309957268', 'https://openalex.org/W4226165006', 'https://openalex.org/W3094502228', 'https://openalex.org/W4312048190', 'https://openalex.org/W2797583228']",2024-01-01

For this task, the videos are required to be aligned both globally and temporally with the input audio: globally, the input audio is semantically associated with the entire output video, and temporally, each segment of the input audio is associated with a corresponding segment of that video. We utilize an existing text-conditioned video generation model and a pre-trained audio encoder model. The proposed method is based on a lightweight adaptor network, which learns to map the audio-based representation to the input representation expected by the text-to-video generation model. As such, it also enables video generation conditioned on text, audio, and, for the first time as far as we can ascertain, on both text and audio. We validate our method extensively on three datasets demonstrating significant semantic diversity of audio-video samples and further propose a novel evaluation metric (AV-Align) to assess the alignment of generated videos with input audio samples. AV-Align is based on the detection and comparison of energy peaks in both modalities. In comparison to recent state-of-the-art approaches, our method generates videos that are better aligned with the input sound, both with respect to content and temporal axis. We also show that videos produced by our method present higher visual quality and are more diverse.

Although both techniques are effective individually, their combined use, called consistent teaching, hasn't been explored before. This paper proposes CED, a simple training framework that distils student models from large teacher ensembles with consistent teaching. To achieve this, CED efficiently stores logits as well as the augmentation methods on disk, making it scalable to large-scale datasets. Central to CED's efficacy is its label-free nature, meaning that only the stored logits are used for the optimization of a student model only requiring 0.3% additional disk space for AS. The study trains various transformer-based models, including a 10M parameter model achieving a 49.0 mean average precision (mAP) on AS. Pretrained models and code are available online.","['https://openalex.org/W4308868387', 'https://openalex.org/W4296068594', 'https://openalex.org/W4375869243', 'https://openalex.org/W3196974791', 'https://openalex.org/W4224917059', 'https://openalex.org/W4226442948', 'https://openalex.org/W6847495150', 'https://openalex.org/W3094550259', 'https://openalex.org/W6840200333', 'https://openalex.org/W3170224286', 'https://openalex.org/W4372260403', 'https://openalex.org/W2593116425', 'https://openalex.org/W4312671791', 'https://openalex.org/W6784333009', 'https://openalex.org/W2936774411', 'https://openalex.org/W4307823382', 'https://openalex.org/W4372260579', 'https://openalex.org/W6802298259', 'https://openalex.org/W6766978945', 'https://openalex.org/W4375869340', 'https://openalex.org/W4379251221', 'https://openalex.org/W6809947431', 'https://openalex.org/W4311731188', 'https://openalex.org/W2747329762', 'https://openalex.org/W4402112408', 'https://openalex.org/W4212774754', 'https://openalex.org/W4312048190', 'https://openalex.org/W4295312788']",2024-03-18
https://openalex.org/W4399146361,https://doi.org/10.1109/tmm.2024.3405622,BAVS: Bootstrapping Audio-Visual Segmentation by Integrating Foundation Knowledge,"Given an audio-visual pair, audio-visual segmentation (AVS) aims to locate sounding sources by predicting pixel-wise maps. Previous methods assume that each sound component in an audio signal always has a visual counterpart in the image. However, this assumption overlooks that off-screen sounds and background noise often contaminate the audio recordings in real-world scenarios. They impose significant challenges on building a consistent semantic mapping between audio and visual signals for AVS models and thus impede precise sound localization. In this work, we propose a two-stage bootstrapping audio-visual segmentation framework by incorporating multi-modal foundation knowledge <inline-formula xmlns:mml=""http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"" xmlns:xlink=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink""><tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$^{1}$</tex-math></inline-formula> In a nutshell, our BAVS is designed to eliminate the interference of background noise or off-screen sounds in segmentation by establishing the audio-visual correspondences in an explicit manner. In the first stage, we employ a segmentation model to localize potential sounding objects from visual data without being affected by contaminated audio signals. Meanwhile, we also utilize a foundation audio classification model to discern audio semantics. Considering the audio tags provided by the audio foundation model are noisy, associating object masks with audio tags is not trivial. Thus, in the second stage, we develop an audio-visual semantic integration strategy (AVIS) to localize the authentic-sounding objects. Here, we construct an audio-visual tree based on the hierarchical correspondence between sounds and object categories. We then examine the label concurrency between the localized objects and classified audio tags by tracing the audio-visual tree. With AVIS, we can effectively segment real-sounding objects.

The proposed method comprises two-stages: the spectral feature classification and the supervised contrastive learning, and it is called as SFC-Sup as a result in this paper. In the first stage, a new spectral feature classification strategy is designed to choose appropriate feature sets for contrastive learning, based on which an instance discrimination pretext task is created by utilizing different spectral features to capture invariant features across segments under different operating conditions. In the second stage, a dynamic weighted loss function is introduced to guide the joint optimization process in the framework of contrastive learning. Different to existing methods which focus on improving the recognition accuracy by designing features for individual segments, the proposed two-stage method SFC-Sup considers consistent features across diverse segments, which is expected to improve recognition accuracy in a continuous recording. Experimental results demonstrate that in the presence of complex operating conditions, SFC-Sup exhibits superior stability and enhances recognition accuracy by 2.06% compared to state-of-the-art methods.","['https://openalex.org/W2794998842', 'https://openalex.org/W2555107250', 'https://openalex.org/W2792295386', 'https://openalex.org/W2920164921', 'https://openalex.org/W3093961233', 'https://openalex.org/W3157467987', 'https://openalex.org/W2794574871', 'https://openalex.org/W2997819422', 'https://openalex.org/W2967719571', 'https://openalex.org/W1914845144', 'https://openalex.org/W2904801617', 'https://openalex.org/W4288064573', 'https://openalex.org/W4387068156', 'https://openalex.org/W4296211525', 'https://openalex.org/W3173499146', 'https://openalex.org/W2781891981', 'https://openalex.org/W2798961812', 'https://openalex.org/W2890964092', 'https://openalex.org/W3024869864', 'https://openalex.org/W3205635414', 'https://openalex.org/W3015499614', 'https://openalex.org/W3016227692', 'https://openalex.org/W6789403026', 'https://openalex.org/W6780105490', 'https://openalex.org/W3135247824', 'https://openalex.org/W4323767251', 'https://openalex.org/W4309918509', 'https://openalex.org/W3119019295', 'https://openalex.org/W2969080949', 'https://openalex.org/W2561682006', 'https://openalex.org/W2975338200', 'https://openalex.org/W3158291757', 'https://openalex.org/W4292970430', 'https://openalex.org/W4313066531', 'https://openalex.org/W4309627742', 'https://openalex.org/W4309214342', 'https://openalex.org/W4385408259', 'https://openalex.org/W2979294696', 'https://openalex.org/W2905385593', 'https://openalex.org/W2939526242', 'https://openalex.org/W3162983744', 'https://openalex.org/W3118027028', 'https://openalex.org/W4297533961', 'https://openalex.org/W4297829726', 'https://openalex.org/W3172124183', 'https://openalex.org/W4295036571', 'https://openalex.org/W3089280383', 'https://openalex.org/W2096733369', 'https://openalex.org/W4308883846', 'https://openalex.org/W3035524453', 'https://openalex.org/W3171007011', 'https://openalex.org/W6809665764', 'https://openalex.org/W2977117446', 'https://openalex.org/W2787894218', 'https://openalex.org/W6776700526', 'https://openalex.org/W3175613352', 'https://openalex.org/W2765407302', 'https://openalex.org/W6848208918', 'https://openalex.org/W2912899030', 'https://openalex.org/W4312443924', 'https://openalex.org/W2963446712', 'https://openalex.org/W6793164127', 'https://openalex.org/W4221146106', 'https://openalex.org/W3121383166', 'https://openalex.org/W4287372095', 'https://openalex.org/W4312048190', 'https://openalex.org/W3040811551']",2023-01-01

In recent years, AAC has quickly attracted research interest, with state-of-the-art systems now relying on a sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) backbone powered by strong models such as Transformers. Following the macro-trend of applied machine learning research, in this work, we strive to improve the performance of seq2seq AAC models by extensively leveraging pretrained models and large language models (LLMs). Specifically, we utilize BEATS to extract fine-grained audio features. Then, we employ Instructor LLM to fetch text embeddings of captions, and infuse their language-modality knowledge into BEATs audio features via an auxiliary InfoNCE loss function. Moreover, we propose a novel data augmentation method that uses ChatGPT to produce caption mix-ups (i.e., grammatical and compact combinations of two captions) which, together with the corresponding audio mixtures, increase not only the amount but also the complexity and diversity of training data. During inference, we propose to employ nucleus sampling and a hybrid reranking algorithm, which has not been explored in AAC research. Combining our efforts, our model achieves a new state-of-the-art 32.6 SPIDEr-FL score on the Clotho evaluation split, and wins the 2023 DCASE AAC challenge.","['https://openalex.org/W2964213897', 'https://openalex.org/W3015591594', 'https://openalex.org/W3094550259', 'https://openalex.org/W4226442948', 'https://openalex.org/W6840200333', 'https://openalex.org/W6848208918', 'https://openalex.org/W2593116425', 'https://openalex.org/W6810738896', 'https://openalex.org/W6850625674', 'https://openalex.org/W4385570594', 'https://openalex.org/W2842511635', 'https://openalex.org/W3097777922', 'https://openalex.org/W2936774411', 'https://openalex.org/W6745136726', 'https://openalex.org/W6851994061', 'https://openalex.org/W4400033239', 'https://openalex.org/W6761551260', 'https://openalex.org/W3034999214', 'https://openalex.org/W6755207826', 'https://openalex.org/W6769627184', 'https://openalex.org/W4386576685', 'https://openalex.org/W3205743929', 'https://openalex.org/W3205860970', 'https://openalex.org/W3209984917', 'https://openalex.org/W2963084599', 'https://openalex.org/W6774314701', 'https://openalex.org/W6799494382', 'https://openalex.org/W4372266552', 'https://openalex.org/W3204358542', 'https://openalex.org/W3153469116', 'https://openalex.org/W4288089799', 'https://openalex.org/W4312048190', 'https://openalex.org/W4297808394', 'https://openalex.org/W4322718191']",2024-03-18

However, underwater environments pose significant challenges due to inherent noise, reverberation, and time-varying acoustic channels. This paper introduces a novel approach for ship target recognition and classification by leveraging the power of three-dimensional (3D) Mel-spectrograms and an additive attention based Transformer (ADDTr). The proposed method utilizes 3D Mel-spectrograms to capture the temporal variations in both target signal and ambient noise, thereby enhancing both categories’ distinguishable characteristics. By incorporating an additional spatial dimension, the modeling of reverberation effects becomes possible. Through analysis of spatial patterns and changes within the spectrograms, distortions caused by reverberation can be estimated and compensated, so that the clarity of the target signals can be improved. The proposed ADDTr leverages an additive attention mechanism to focus on informative acoustic features while suppressing the influence of noisy or distorted components. This attention-based approach not only enhances the discriminative power of the model but also accelerates the recognition process. It efficiently captures both temporal and spatial dependencies, enabling accurate analysis of complex acoustic signals and precise predictions. Comprehensive comparisons with state-of-the-art acoustic target recognition models on the ShipsEar dataset demonstrate the superiority of the proposed ADDTr approach. Achieving an accuracy of 96.82% with the lowest computation costs, ADDTr outperforms other models.","['https://openalex.org/W6776048684', 'https://openalex.org/W6778883912', 'https://openalex.org/W4226442948', 'https://openalex.org/W6755207826', 'https://openalex.org/W3093961233', 'https://openalex.org/W6784333009', 'https://openalex.org/W4206818797', 'https://openalex.org/W4292970430', 'https://openalex.org/W2042274006', 'https://openalex.org/W6674640772', 'https://openalex.org/W2977443649', 'https://openalex.org/W2102372511', 'https://openalex.org/W2090211080', 'https://openalex.org/W1979435096', 'https://openalex.org/W3196974791', 'https://openalex.org/W2090861223', 'https://openalex.org/W3090489746', 'https://openalex.org/W4290712918', 'https://openalex.org/W3167369733', 'https://openalex.org/W3199069548', 'https://openalex.org/W4303712167', 'https://openalex.org/W3138516171', 'https://openalex.org/W2786525131', 'https://openalex.org/W2132984323', 'https://openalex.org/W3108860493', 'https://openalex.org/W2931364255', 'https://openalex.org/W2002870586', 'https://openalex.org/W2466903746', 'https://openalex.org/W1992137233', 'https://openalex.org/W2905385593', 'https://openalex.org/W4312966247', 'https://openalex.org/W2976146944', 'https://openalex.org/W3108951462', 'https://openalex.org/W3119043017', 'https://openalex.org/W6739901393', 'https://openalex.org/W1515206890', 'https://openalex.org/W2987957547', 'https://openalex.org/W3174794493', 'https://openalex.org/W2792295386', 'https://openalex.org/W2294532759', 'https://openalex.org/W2920164921', 'https://openalex.org/W3066886056', 'https://openalex.org/W2233773529', 'https://openalex.org/W6781533629', 'https://openalex.org/W2140010911', 'https://openalex.org/W3199238425', 'https://openalex.org/W2977117446', 'https://openalex.org/W4385245566', 'https://openalex.org/W4295838474', 'https://openalex.org/W2896457183', 'https://openalex.org/W4292779060', 'https://openalex.org/W3015468748', 'https://openalex.org/W2096125904', 'https://openalex.org/W3021293129', 'https://openalex.org/W3094502228', 'https://openalex.org/W4287704453', 'https://openalex.org/W4312048190', 'https://openalex.org/W3033529678', 'https://openalex.org/W4296068596']",2023-11-24

Constrained by the data hungry nature of transformers and the limited amount of labelled data, most transformer-based models for audio tasks are finetuned from ImageNet pretrained models, despite the huge gap between the domain of natural images and audio. This has motivated the research in self-supervised pretraining of audio transformers, which reduces the dependency on large amounts of labeled data and focuses on extracting concise representations of audio spectrograms.

We evaluate our pretrained models on both audio and speech classification tasks, including audio event classification, keyword spotting, and speaker identification. We further conduct comprehensive ablation studies, including evaluations of different pretraining strategies. The proposed ASiT framework significantly boosts the performance on all tasks and sets a new state-of-the-art performance in five audio and speech classification tasks, outperforming recent methods, including the approaches that use additional datasets for pretraining.","['https://openalex.org/W3170874841', 'https://openalex.org/W3094550259', 'https://openalex.org/W3196974791', 'https://openalex.org/W2163605009', 'https://openalex.org/W2025768430', 'https://openalex.org/W3005680577', 'https://openalex.org/W2899663614', 'https://openalex.org/W3093475354', 'https://openalex.org/W2936774411', 'https://openalex.org/W2981087920', 'https://openalex.org/W1821462560', 'https://openalex.org/W4375869340', 'https://openalex.org/W4225911888', 'https://openalex.org/W2768188490', 'https://openalex.org/W4224993428', 'https://openalex.org/W2798991696', 'https://openalex.org/W4312804044', 'https://openalex.org/W3015949486', 'https://openalex.org/W3170863103', 'https://openalex.org/W4308847350', 'https://openalex.org/W3206996142', 'https://openalex.org/W3186781156', 'https://openalex.org/W3159481202', 'https://openalex.org/W3036601975', 'https://openalex.org/W4285483774', 'https://openalex.org/W3035524453', 'https://openalex.org/W2963677766', 'https://openalex.org/W4312048190', 'https://openalex.org/W1494198834', 'https://openalex.org/W2137944862', 'https://openalex.org/W4385245566', 'https://openalex.org/W2561826558', 'https://openalex.org/W3162391496', 'https://openalex.org/W4297841853', 'https://openalex.org/W3035060554', 'https://openalex.org/W2526050071', 'https://openalex.org/W2887997457', 'https://openalex.org/W4287236261', 'https://openalex.org/W4297808394', 'https://openalex.org/W3201143670', 'https://openalex.org/W2154211011', 'https://openalex.org/W2593116425', 'https://openalex.org/W2768282280', 'https://openalex.org/W2797583228', 'https://openalex.org/W3016181583', 'https://openalex.org/W3134652006', 'https://openalex.org/W3035468615', 'https://openalex.org/W2963425185', 'https://openalex.org/W2979476256', 'https://openalex.org/W4398958419', 'https://openalex.org/W3094502228', 'https://openalex.org/W1614298861', 'https://openalex.org/W4296960042', 'https://openalex.org/W1604034532', 'https://openalex.org/W3205475937', 'https://openalex.org/W2896457183']",2022-11-23

However, researchers face challenges due to the costly and time-consuming collection process of existing audio-language datasets, which are limited in size. To address this data scarcity issue, we introduce WavCaps, the first large-scale weakly-labelled audio captioning dataset, comprising approximately 400k audio clips with paired captions. We sourced audio clips and their raw descriptions from web sources and a sound event detection dataset. However, the online-harvested raw descriptions are highly noisy and unsuitable for direct use in tasks such as automated audio captioning. To overcome this issue, we propose a three-stage processing pipeline for filtering noisy data and generating high-quality captions, where ChatGPT, a large language model, is leveraged to filter and transform raw descriptions automatically. We conduct a comprehensive analysis of the characteristics of WavCaps dataset and evaluate it on multiple downstream audio-language multimodal learning tasks.

MC-SimCLR learns joint spectral and spatial representations from unlabeled spatial audios, thereby enhancing both event classification and sound localization in downstream tasks. At its core, we propose a multi-level data augmentation pipeline that augments different levels of audio features, including waveforms, Mel spectrograms, and generalized cross-correlation (GCC) features. In addition, we introduce simple yet effective channel-wise augmentation methods to randomly swap the order of the microphones and mask Mel and GCC channels. By using these augmentations, we find that linear layers on top of the learned representation significantly outperform supervised models in terms of both event classification accuracy and localization error. We also perform a comprehensive analysis of the effect of each augmentation method and a comparison of the fine-tuning performance using different amounts of labeled data.","['https://openalex.org/W3206996142', 'https://openalex.org/W6840200333', 'https://openalex.org/W6848208918', 'https://openalex.org/W6774314701', 'https://openalex.org/W3213455868', 'https://openalex.org/W3113688134', 'https://openalex.org/W2810934215', 'https://openalex.org/W6798797903', 'https://openalex.org/W4324116353', 'https://openalex.org/W3206619923', 'https://openalex.org/W3137857706', 'https://openalex.org/W3162391496', 'https://openalex.org/W6791429434', 'https://openalex.org/W6779326418', 'https://openalex.org/W3201143670', 'https://openalex.org/W6605165268', 'https://openalex.org/W4312800393', 'https://openalex.org/W7049032787', 'https://openalex.org/W6791537541', 'https://openalex.org/W3083274258', 'https://openalex.org/W2942551338', 'https://openalex.org/W6785703896', 'https://openalex.org/W6745136726', 'https://openalex.org/W2936774411', 'https://openalex.org/W2963859210', 'https://openalex.org/W2898268964', 'https://openalex.org/W4205689591', 'https://openalex.org/W6726497184', 'https://openalex.org/W4312048190', 'https://openalex.org/W4394641766', 'https://openalex.org/W3139211892', 'https://openalex.org/W1583837637', 'https://openalex.org/W3134486096', 'https://openalex.org/W3035060554', 'https://openalex.org/W126779258', 'https://openalex.org/W2747329762', 'https://openalex.org/W3117314925', 'https://openalex.org/W4285483774', 'https://openalex.org/W3104196160', 'https://openalex.org/W3098454764']",2024-03-18

However, prevailing methods typically demand extensively labeled audio datasets and have highly customized frameworks, imposing substantial computational and annotation loads. In this study, we present an efficient and general framework called SSL-Net, which combines spectral and learned features to identify different bird sounds. Encouraging empirical results gleaned from a standard field-collected bird audio dataset validate the efficacy of our method in extracting features efficiently and achieving heightened performance in bird sound classification, even when working with limited sample sizes. Furthermore, we present three feature fusion strategies, aiding engineers and researchers in their selection through quantitative analysis.","['https://openalex.org/W4364375273', 'https://openalex.org/W2581706890', 'https://openalex.org/W6758780191', 'https://openalex.org/W4379929801', 'https://openalex.org/W2194775991', 'https://openalex.org/W6789403026', 'https://openalex.org/W6848208918', 'https://openalex.org/W4296106947', 'https://openalex.org/W2944806726', 'https://openalex.org/W3119043017', 'https://openalex.org/W3173678936', 'https://openalex.org/W4283703475', 'https://openalex.org/W4220973791', 'https://openalex.org/W4283837884', 'https://openalex.org/W4205396838', 'https://openalex.org/W4284899153', 'https://openalex.org/W3094550259', 'https://openalex.org/W4385245566', 'https://openalex.org/W6729448088', 'https://openalex.org/W4285428678', 'https://openalex.org/W4312048190', 'https://openalex.org/W2913454197', 'https://openalex.org/W2547875792']",2024-03-18

general-purpose representations for various video understanding tasks by leveraging large-scale datasets and powerful models to capture robust and generic features from video data.This survey analyzes over 200 methods, offering a comprehensive overview of benchmarks and evaluation metrics across 15 distinct video tasks, categorized into three main groups.Additionally, we provide an in-depth performance analysis of these models for the six most common video tasks.We identify three main approaches to constructing ViFMs: 1) Image-based ViFMs, which adapt image foundation models for video tasks; 2) Video-based ViFMs, which utilize video-specific encoding methods; and 3) Universal Foundation Models (UFMs), which integrate multiple modalities (image, video, audio, text, etc.) within a single framework.Each approach is further subdivided based on either practical implementation perspectives or pretraining objective types.By comparing the performance of various ViFMs on common video tasks, we offer valuable insights into their strengths and weaknesses, guiding future advancements in video understanding.Our analysis reveals that image-based ViFMs consistently outperform video-based ViFMs on most video understanding tasks.Additionally, UFMs, which leverage diverse modalities, demonstrate superior performance across all video tasks.We provide the comprehensive list of

Despite the difference in information distribution between audio spectrograms and natural images, there has been limited exploration of effective information retrieval from spectrograms using domain-specific layers tailored for the audio domain. In this paper, we leverage the power of the Multi-Axis Vision Transformer (MaxViT) to create DTF-AT (Decoupled Time-Frequency Audio Transformer) that facilitates interactions across time, frequency, spatial, and channel dimensions. The proposed DTF-AT architecture is rigorously evaluated across diverse audio and speech classification tasks, consistently establishing new benchmarks for state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance. Notably, on the challenging AudioSet 2M classification task, our approach demonstrates a substantial improvement of 4.4% when the model is trained from scratch and 3.2% when the model is initialised from ImageNet-1K pretrained weights. In addition, we present comprehensive ablation studies to investigate the impact and efficacy of our proposed approach. The codebase and pretrained weights are available on https://github.com/ta012/DTFAT.git","['https://openalex.org/W3093475354', 'https://openalex.org/W4221095487', 'https://openalex.org/W3171087525', 'https://openalex.org/W6676297131', 'https://openalex.org/W6794053914', 'https://openalex.org/W2593116425', 'https://openalex.org/W3164279099', 'https://openalex.org/W3206996142', 'https://openalex.org/W6743731764', 'https://openalex.org/W6701947533', 'https://openalex.org/W2994728585', 'https://openalex.org/W3205475937', 'https://openalex.org/W4226209339', 'https://openalex.org/W3138516171', 'https://openalex.org/W3135828102', 'https://openalex.org/W2936774411', 'https://openalex.org/W4398958419', 'https://openalex.org/W3093563057', 'https://openalex.org/W6810003034', 'https://openalex.org/W6797790494', 'https://openalex.org/W6840263907', 'https://openalex.org/W4330340007', 'https://openalex.org/W4287203089', 'https://openalex.org/W2797583228', 'https://openalex.org/W4372267124', 'https://openalex.org/W4309845474', 'https://openalex.org/W4297775537', 'https://openalex.org/W3175544090', 'https://openalex.org/W4372260443', 'https://openalex.org/W4312769131', 'https://openalex.org/W4286278015', 'https://openalex.org/W4297841853', 'https://openalex.org/W2108598243', 'https://openalex.org/W3201143670', 'https://openalex.org/W4309957268', 'https://openalex.org/W2331143823', 'https://openalex.org/W4226442948', 'https://openalex.org/W4224993428', 'https://openalex.org/W2526050071', 'https://openalex.org/W3094502228', 'https://openalex.org/W4285483774', 'https://openalex.org/W4312048190', 'https://openalex.org/W2768188490', 'https://openalex.org/W4312847199', 'https://openalex.org/W4287236261', 'https://openalex.org/W3205743929', 'https://openalex.org/W3196974791', 'https://openalex.org/W2908510526', 'https://openalex.org/W3094550259']",2024-03-24

Thus, recent advances in self-supervised learning present a largely-unexplored opportunity for improving separation models by leveraging unlabelled music data. In this paper, we propose a self-supervised learning framework for music source separation inspired by the HuBERT speech representation model. We first investigate the potential impact of the original HuBERT model by inserting an adapted version of it into the well-known Demucs V2 time-domain separation architecture. We then propose Paᗧ-HuBERT, a time-frequency-domain self-supervised model, that we later use in combination with a ResU-Net decoder for source separation. Paᗧ-HuBERT uses primitive auditory features of music as unsupervised clustering labels to initialize the self-supervised pretraining process using the Free Music Archive (FMA) dataset. The resulting framework achieves better source-to-distortion ratio (SDR) performance on the MusDB18 test set than the original Demucs V2 and Res-U-Net models. We further demonstrate that it can boost performance with small amounts of supervised data. Ultimately, our proposed framework is an effective solution to the challenge of limited clean source data for music source separation.","['https://openalex.org/W3205091761', 'https://openalex.org/W2990594533', 'https://openalex.org/W4284898017', 'https://openalex.org/W3037149862', 'https://openalex.org/W3138202130', 'https://openalex.org/W2995181338', 'https://openalex.org/W3160719641', 'https://openalex.org/W1494198834', 'https://openalex.org/W6801426729', 'https://openalex.org/W6804608017', 'https://openalex.org/W6809947431', 'https://openalex.org/W6846880785', 'https://openalex.org/W6848208918', 'https://openalex.org/W6845155585', 'https://openalex.org/W2982471419', 'https://openalex.org/W3199957557', 'https://openalex.org/W6846884369', 'https://openalex.org/W6674917984', 'https://openalex.org/W3209984917', 'https://openalex.org/W6756526489', 'https://openalex.org/W6739901393', 'https://openalex.org/W4312095873', 'https://openalex.org/W2018735295', 'https://openalex.org/W1976069042', 'https://openalex.org/W6783557883', 'https://openalex.org/W2973049979', 'https://openalex.org/W6780730805', 'https://openalex.org/W2773594497', 'https://openalex.org/W6755207826', 'https://openalex.org/W6732646663', 'https://openalex.org/W6657159850', 'https://openalex.org/W2972411915', 'https://openalex.org/W6656179950', 'https://openalex.org/W6739622702', 'https://openalex.org/W2962935966', 'https://openalex.org/W6751512325', 'https://openalex.org/W4226442948', 'https://openalex.org/W3206996142', 'https://openalex.org/W4296069264', 'https://openalex.org/W6840200333', 'https://openalex.org/W3207924272', 'https://openalex.org/W6766320909', 'https://openalex.org/W3198270377', 'https://openalex.org/W3209059054', 'https://openalex.org/W6697668227', 'https://openalex.org/W4221150524', 'https://openalex.org/W4319862462', 'https://openalex.org/W4375928773', 'https://openalex.org/W4298310324', 'https://openalex.org/W4385245566', 'https://openalex.org/W2896457183', 'https://openalex.org/W3138296617', 'https://openalex.org/W2022668263', 'https://openalex.org/W2902541609', 'https://openalex.org/W2296573765', 'https://openalex.org/W2916985722', 'https://openalex.org/W2580221632', 'https://openalex.org/W3090496396', 'https://openalex.org/W2622263826', 'https://openalex.org/W2407513162', 'https://openalex.org/W4286980120', 'https://openalex.org/W4312048190', 'https://openalex.org/W3043992176', 'https://openalex.org/W2100772705', 'https://openalex.org/W2963452667', 'https://openalex.org/W3216004336', 'https://openalex.org/W4372260250', 'https://openalex.org/W4285483774']",2023-06-04

However, the training of high-performance sound event detection models depends on high-quality strong-label datasets, which brings great pressure and cost to the labeling work of datasets. In this paper, we propose a weakly supervised sound event detection method based on Puzzle Class Activation Map(CAM), which aims to obtain the timestamp information of sound events from a sound event classification network trained by weak labels. Specifically, the method discovers more complete regions of sound events by minimizing the difference between the CAM of the original features and the merged CAM of the separated feature blocks. CAM highlights the feature capture in the time dimension during the model decision-making process. We determine the occurrence time of the sound event based on the position of the frame where the feature is located, and use the model classification prediction to guide the CAM output to achieve weakly supervised sound event detection. Experiments on the Domestic Environment Sound Event Detection Dataset demonstrate that our proposed method exhibits superior performance compared to the baseline system in the task of sound event detection. Specifically, The CAM of a single system achieves the best PSDS2 value of 0.732. Furthermore, when utilizing the CAM ensemble of multiple systems, the PSDS2 value improves to 0.751. Both of these values are higher than those achieved by the baseline system.","['https://openalex.org/W2964274719', 'https://openalex.org/W4221149441', 'https://openalex.org/W3202524699', 'https://openalex.org/W6755207826', 'https://openalex.org/W4386113282', 'https://openalex.org/W6739901393', 'https://openalex.org/W4312647976', 'https://openalex.org/W3035253074', 'https://openalex.org/W2765793020', 'https://openalex.org/W2591013610', 'https://openalex.org/W3203036314', 'https://openalex.org/W2746554716', 'https://openalex.org/W6791688177', 'https://openalex.org/W6780411803', 'https://openalex.org/W2959539607', 'https://openalex.org/W3162999565', 'https://openalex.org/W6802608170', 'https://openalex.org/W3097777922', 'https://openalex.org/W6848208918', 'https://openalex.org/W3196974791', 'https://openalex.org/W6852791012', 'https://openalex.org/W4224920041', 'https://openalex.org/W3015190346', 'https://openalex.org/W3094550259', 'https://openalex.org/W3203468141', 'https://openalex.org/W2936774411', 'https://openalex.org/W2295107390', 'https://openalex.org/W3125080173', 'https://openalex.org/W2962858109', 'https://openalex.org/W2963099423', 'https://openalex.org/W6704490260', 'https://openalex.org/W6802291199', 'https://openalex.org/W3006275583', 'https://openalex.org/W2966415767', 'https://openalex.org/W6733814495', 'https://openalex.org/W2408239454', 'https://openalex.org/W2953070460', 'https://openalex.org/W3138191931', 'https://openalex.org/W4380551836', 'https://openalex.org/W4200079260', 'https://openalex.org/W4312048190', 'https://openalex.org/W3109837239', 'https://openalex.org/W2342547278', 'https://openalex.org/W2896457183', 'https://openalex.org/W4385245566', 'https://openalex.org/W3204005682']",2023-01-01

We study this problem in the context of Acoustic Scene Classification (ASC) with mismatching recording devices. Previous works successfully employed frequency-wise normalization of inputs and hidden layer activations in convolutional neural networks to reduce the recording device discrepancy. The main objective of this work was to adopt frequency-wise normalization for Audio Spectrogram Transformers (ASTs), which have recently become the dominant model architecture in ASC. To this end, we first investigate how recording device characteristics are encoded in the hidden layer activations of ASTs. We find that recording device information is initially encoded in the frequency dimension; however, after the first self-attention block, it is largely transformed into the token dimension. Based on this observation, we conjecture that suppressing recording device characteristics in the input spectrogram is the most effective. We propose a frequency-centering operation for spectrograms that improves the ASC performance on unseen recording devices on average by up to 18.2 percentage points.","['https://openalex.org/W6810841414', 'https://openalex.org/W3206996142', 'https://openalex.org/W2936774411', 'https://openalex.org/W6784333009', 'https://openalex.org/W6810510949', 'https://openalex.org/W4205689591', 'https://openalex.org/W6780226713', 'https://openalex.org/W6745136726', 'https://openalex.org/W4283693214', 'https://openalex.org/W3205475937', 'https://openalex.org/W6792861227', 'https://openalex.org/W6631190155', 'https://openalex.org/W2593116425', 'https://openalex.org/W2052666245', 'https://openalex.org/W6809947431', 'https://openalex.org/W6753385908', 'https://openalex.org/W3166601111', 'https://openalex.org/W6724804524', 'https://openalex.org/W6752516136', 'https://openalex.org/W6848208918', 'https://openalex.org/W6751546485', 'https://openalex.org/W2147800946', 'https://openalex.org/W3094502228', 'https://openalex.org/W4375869340', 'https://openalex.org/W1522301498', 'https://openalex.org/W2502312327', 'https://openalex.org/W4221150524', 'https://openalex.org/W4224980507', 'https://openalex.org/W2884366600', 'https://openalex.org/W3196974791', 'https://openalex.org/W4312048190', 'https://openalex.org/W2765407302', 'https://openalex.org/W4295723153', 'https://openalex.org/W2803808038']",2023-09-04

Empirical results on ten downstream audio tasks show that MW-MAEs consistently outperform standard MAEs in overall performance and learn better general-purpose audio representations, along with demonstrating considerably better scaling characteristics. Investigating attention distances and entropies reveals that MW-MAE encoders learn heads with broader local and global attention. Analyzing attention head feature representations through Projection Weighted Canonical Correlation Analysis (PWCCA) shows that attention heads with the same window sizes across the decoder layers of the MW-MAE learn correlated feature representations which enables each block to independently capture local and global information, leading to a decoupled decoder feature hierarchy.

Conversely, Instance Discrimination (ID) emphasizes high-level semantics, offering a potential solution to alleviate annotation requirements in MAEs. Although combining these two approaches can address downstream tasks with limited labeled data, naively integrating ID into MAEs leads to extended training times and high computational costs. To address this challenge, we introduce uaMix-MAE, an efficient ID tuning strategy that leverages unsupervised audio mixtures. Utilizing contrastive tuning, uaMix-MAE aligns the representations of pretrained MAEs, thereby facilitating effective adaptation to task-specific semantics. To optimize the model with small amounts of unlabeled data, we propose an audio mixing technique that manipulates audio samples in both input and virtual label spaces. Experiments in low/few-shot settings demonstrate that uaMix-MAE achieves 4 − 6% accuracy improvements over various benchmarks when tuned with limited unlabeled data, such as AudioSet-20K.","['https://openalex.org/W3035524453', 'https://openalex.org/W6774314701', 'https://openalex.org/W4313156423', 'https://openalex.org/W6778883912', 'https://openalex.org/W2896457183', 'https://openalex.org/W6840200333', 'https://openalex.org/W6848208918', 'https://openalex.org/W4297841853', 'https://openalex.org/W3201143670', 'https://openalex.org/W3162391496', 'https://openalex.org/W4284898017', 'https://openalex.org/W3196974791', 'https://openalex.org/W4385823422', 'https://openalex.org/W3094502228', 'https://openalex.org/W6796761347', 'https://openalex.org/W6790978476', 'https://openalex.org/W4393159256', 'https://openalex.org/W2117539524', 'https://openalex.org/W4283810973', 'https://openalex.org/W4313069509', 'https://openalex.org/W4375869340', 'https://openalex.org/W6810510949', 'https://openalex.org/W4372341324', 'https://openalex.org/W3158714121', 'https://openalex.org/W6745136726', 'https://openalex.org/W2992308087', 'https://openalex.org/W6791713434', 'https://openalex.org/W2593116425', 'https://openalex.org/W2052666245', 'https://openalex.org/W2726515241', 'https://openalex.org/W6736723571', 'https://openalex.org/W6753583920', 'https://openalex.org/W3176276772', 'https://openalex.org/W4322718191', 'https://openalex.org/W3170863103', 'https://openalex.org/W2797583228', 'https://openalex.org/W4224980507', 'https://openalex.org/W2884535146', 'https://openalex.org/W2187089797', 'https://openalex.org/W4312048190', 'https://openalex.org/W3129576130', 'https://openalex.org/W2913289886', 'https://openalex.org/W2606176153', 'https://openalex.org/W3005680577', 'https://openalex.org/W3136810184', 'https://openalex.org/W2765407302', 'https://openalex.org/W4292779060', 'https://openalex.org/W4285483774']",2024-03-18

In this work, we propose to collect recordings of Mandarin and Spanish, namely the Mandarin-Spanish-Speech Dataset (MSSD-40), to analyze the performance of various audio embeddings for cross-lingual speaker recognition tasks. All participants are fluent in Mandarin, but none of the participants have prior knowledge of the Spanish language. As such, they have been advised to adopt a parroting mode of Spanish speech production, wherein they simply repeat the sounds emanating from the loudspeaker. Using this approach, variations resulting from individual differences in language fluency can be reduced, enabling us to focus on the anatomical aspects of the speech production mechanism.Embeddings extracted from models pre-trained with a large number of audio segments have become effective solutions for coping with audio analysis tasks using small datasets. Preliminary experimental results using two collected multi-lingual datasets indicate that both embedding methods and the language employed will affect the robustness of the speaker recognition task. Precisely, stable performance is observed when familiar languages are used.

Nevertheless, advancement is impeded by two principal challenges: (1) a lack of high‐quality 3D data, and (2) inadequate modelling of the multi‐scale characteristics of speech signals. In this paper, we present Speech2Face3D, a novel two‐stage transfer‐learning framework that pretrains on large‐scale pseudo‐3D facial data derived from 2D videos and subsequently finetunes on smaller yet high‐fidelity 3D datasets. This design leverages the richness of easily accessible 2D resources while mitigating reconstruction noise through a simple temporal smoothing step. Our approach further introduces a Multi‐Scale Hierarchical Audio Encoder to capture subtle phoneme transitions, mid‐range prosody, and longer‐range emotional cues.

StyleTTS 2 differs from its predecessor by modeling styles as a latent random variable through diffusion models to generate the most suitable style for the text without requiring reference speech, achieving efficient latent diffusion while benefiting from the diverse speech synthesis offered by diffusion models. Furthermore, we employ large pre-trained SLMs, such as WavLM, as discriminators with our novel differentiable duration modeling for end-to-end training, resulting in improved speech naturalness. StyleTTS 2 surpasses human recordings on the single-speaker LJSpeech dataset and matches it on the multispeaker VCTK dataset as judged by native English speakers. Moreover, when trained on the LibriTTS dataset, our model outperforms previous publicly available models for zero-shot speaker adaptation. This work achieves the first human-level TTS on both single and multispeaker datasets, showcasing the potential of style diffusion and adversarial training with large SLMs. The audio demos and source code are available at https://styletts2.github.io/.","['https://openalex.org/W4280561221', 'https://openalex.org/W4281661987', 'https://openalex.org/W4362655923', 'https://openalex.org/W4320451749', 'https://openalex.org/W3209984917', 'https://openalex.org/W3169386841', 'https://openalex.org/W2603777577', 'https://openalex.org/W3197294703', 'https://openalex.org/W4372267432', 'https://openalex.org/W2976159681', 'https://openalex.org/W4200300291', 'https://openalex.org/W2593414223', 'https://openalex.org/W4285483538', 'https://openalex.org/W4221152438', 'https://openalex.org/W4303519914', 'https://openalex.org/W3197273793', 'https://openalex.org/W4281736089', 'https://openalex.org/W3174758275', 'https://openalex.org/W2972359262', 'https://openalex.org/W4225566824', 'https://openalex.org/W4368755563', 'https://openalex.org/W3209059054', 'https://openalex.org/W4319862431', 'https://openalex.org/W3036601975', 'https://openalex.org/W3172148458', 'https://openalex.org/W4287117449', 'https://openalex.org/W4360890968', 'https://openalex.org/W3197324626', 'https://openalex.org/W4287761884', 'https://openalex.org/W4226063663', 'https://openalex.org/W4367000116', 'https://openalex.org/W4385245566', 'https://openalex.org/W4313679638', 'https://openalex.org/W3034302232', 'https://openalex.org/W4287120591', 'https://openalex.org/W4226132755', 'https://openalex.org/W3198213150', 'https://openalex.org/W4320057414', 'https://openalex.org/W4319862245', 'https://openalex.org/W4224612669', 'https://openalex.org/W4281969232', 'https://openalex.org/W4286869901', 'https://openalex.org/W2768282280', 'https://openalex.org/W4226380987', 'https://openalex.org/W4385822565', 'https://openalex.org/W4296068816', 'https://openalex.org/W4224931676', 'https://openalex.org/W2962780374', 'https://openalex.org/W4319862675', 'https://openalex.org/W3092028330', 'https://openalex.org/W3091928890', 'https://openalex.org/W4297841714', 'https://openalex.org/W3196667132', 'https://openalex.org/W4225680573', 'https://openalex.org/W4323697273', 'https://openalex.org/W3129651364', 'https://openalex.org/W4287121924', 'https://openalex.org/W3110257065', 'https://openalex.org/W4367359628', 'https://openalex.org/W3123097577', 'https://openalex.org/W4366460484']",2023-06-13

VoiceFlow formulates the process of generating mel-spectrograms into an ordinary differential equation conditional on text inputs, whose vector field is then estimated. The rectified flow technique then effectively straightens its sampling trajectory for efficient synthesis.

Most existing TSE methods employ discrimination-based models to estimate the target speaker's proportion in the mixture, but they often fail to compensate for the missing or highly corrupted frequency components in the speech signal. In contrast, the generation-based methods can naturally handle such scenarios via speech resynthesis. In this paper, we propose a novel discrete token based TSE approach by combining state-of-the-art speech discretization and vocoder techniques. By predicting a sequence of discrete tokens with the auxiliary audio and employing a vocoder that takes discrete tokens as input, the target speech can be effectively re-synthesized while eliminating interference. Our experiments conducted on the WSJ0-2mix and Libri2mix datasets demonstrate that our proposed method yields high-quality target speech without interference.","['https://openalex.org/W4372260086', 'https://openalex.org/W2951130829', 'https://openalex.org/W4385823017', 'https://openalex.org/W4385822827', 'https://openalex.org/W2973062255', 'https://openalex.org/W4372271325', 'https://openalex.org/W4296068983', 'https://openalex.org/W4283074506', 'https://openalex.org/W4296070363', 'https://openalex.org/W6783867762', 'https://openalex.org/W4385822449', 'https://openalex.org/W4375869120', 'https://openalex.org/W4372341629', 'https://openalex.org/W4375869052', 'https://openalex.org/W4372266927', 'https://openalex.org/W4372260127', 'https://openalex.org/W6805530253', 'https://openalex.org/W4307323391', 'https://openalex.org/W3209059054', 'https://openalex.org/W6769196770', 'https://openalex.org/W2973049979', 'https://openalex.org/W2221409856', 'https://openalex.org/W6777776875', 'https://openalex.org/W3016361963', 'https://openalex.org/W2972359262', 'https://openalex.org/W3151851237', 'https://openalex.org/W4200634403', 'https://openalex.org/W4224938485', 'https://openalex.org/W4393147067', 'https://openalex.org/W1494198834', 'https://openalex.org/W4225302959', 'https://openalex.org/W3103434036', 'https://openalex.org/W4200635400', 'https://openalex.org/W3027008958']",2024-03-18

We describe how such a model can be constructed using a non-autoregressive, transformer-based model architecture and present a number of novel architectural and sampling improvements. We train the described architecture on both an open-source and a proprietary dataset. We evaluate the produced models using standard quality metrics and a new approach based on music information retrieval descriptors.

Despite their versatility, they require estimating the joint distribution over the sources, necessitating pre-separated musical data, which is rarely available, and fixing the number and type of sources at training time. This paper generalizes MSDM to arbitrary time-domain diffusion models conditioned on text embeddings. These models do not require separated data as they are trained on mixtures, can parameterize an arbitrary number of sources, and allow for rich semantic control. We propose an inference procedure enabling the coherent generation of sources and accompaniments. Additionally, we adapt the Dirac separator of MSDM to perform source separation. We experiment with diffusion models trained on Slakh2100 and MTG-Jamendo, showcasing competitive generation and separation results in a relaxed data setting.","['https://openalex.org/W2752796333', 'https://openalex.org/W6765775151', 'https://openalex.org/W6779823529', 'https://openalex.org/W6786375611', 'https://openalex.org/W4396877837', 'https://openalex.org/W6769627184', 'https://openalex.org/W4225314222', 'https://openalex.org/W4372266552', 'https://openalex.org/W4372260310', 'https://openalex.org/W4401023775', 'https://openalex.org/W6840815571', 'https://openalex.org/W6774212381', 'https://openalex.org/W2998490864', 'https://openalex.org/W6763945542', 'https://openalex.org/W6838327568', 'https://openalex.org/W2972478942', 'https://openalex.org/W2964058413', 'https://openalex.org/W4225293699', 'https://openalex.org/W4362598673', 'https://openalex.org/W4318351475', 'https://openalex.org/W4318719023', 'https://openalex.org/W4281661987', 'https://openalex.org/W4383047490', 'https://openalex.org/W4380136719', 'https://openalex.org/W4383993968', 'https://openalex.org/W3036167779', 'https://openalex.org/W4392903555', 'https://openalex.org/W2963799213', 'https://openalex.org/W2959300817', 'https://openalex.org/W4319452539', 'https://openalex.org/W4288089799']",2024-03-18

However, no existing music generation model has been able to produce authentic waveform-level traditional Chinese music. To explore the potential of this field and address the limitations of current technologies in generating traditional Chinese music, this study introduces CPTGZ (Chinese Painting to Guzheng Music), a music generation model based on latent diffusion and Transformer architectures. CPTGZ aims to achieve automatic generation of waveform-level Guzheng music from Chinese paintings, thereby addressing the inability of existing music generation models to produce traditional Chinese music.To support the development and training of the model, we constructed a large-scale dataset of paired Chinese paintings and Guzheng music, consisting of 22,103 sample pairs. Through experimental evaluation, we found that CPTGZ exhibits excellent performance in terms of music quality and Guzheng-specific characteristics. The results demonstrate that our model can generate Chinese Guzheng music pieces highly correlated in style and semantics with the input Chinese paintings. Furthermore, the musical qualities of the generated Guzheng compositions demonstrate the characteristics of traditional Chinese music, thus validating the feasibility and effectiveness of our model.This research contributes to the field of AI-driven music generation by addressing the specific challenges of creating authentic traditional Chinese music, particularly Guzheng compositions, based on visual art inputs. The successful implementation of CPTGZ not only opens new avenues for cross-modal generation in the domain of culturally specific art forms, but also demonstrates the potential for AI to preserve and innovate within traditional art forms.","['https://openalex.org/W4312933868', 'https://openalex.org/W4252337780', 'https://openalex.org/W6843673214', 'https://openalex.org/W6783867762', 'https://openalex.org/W6776218486', 'https://openalex.org/W6845479124', 'https://openalex.org/W4372266552', 'https://openalex.org/W6849109464', 'https://openalex.org/W4381786045', 'https://openalex.org/W4226033575', 'https://openalex.org/W3215615641', 'https://openalex.org/W6852240503', 'https://openalex.org/W6847076894', 'https://openalex.org/W6859583170', 'https://openalex.org/W6796762324', 'https://openalex.org/W6839133533', 'https://openalex.org/W6841982715', 'https://openalex.org/W6849105126', 'https://openalex.org/W6849635556', 'https://openalex.org/W4383993968', 'https://openalex.org/W6849517043', 'https://openalex.org/W6855718144', 'https://openalex.org/W6855355973', 'https://openalex.org/W6848854281', 'https://openalex.org/W6755257315', 'https://openalex.org/W6859169327', 'https://openalex.org/W6860273036', 'https://openalex.org/W6861353174', 'https://openalex.org/W3159771761', 'https://openalex.org/W4318185472', 'https://openalex.org/W4389322778', 'https://openalex.org/W4296693672', 'https://openalex.org/W2975076716', 'https://openalex.org/W3015523571', 'https://openalex.org/W4296252852', 'https://openalex.org/W6850625674', 'https://openalex.org/W6739901393', 'https://openalex.org/W2758804652', 'https://openalex.org/W2619383789', 'https://openalex.org/W6719558590']",2024-01-01

An audio frame (e.g. 20ms) is typically represented by a set of discrete codes (e.g. 4) computed by a neural codec. Autoregressive decoding typically generates a few thousands of codes per song, which is prohibitively slow and implies introducing some parallel decoding. In this paper we compare different decoding strategies that aim to understand what codes can be decoded in parallel without penalizing the quality too much. We propose a novel stack-and-delay style of decoding to improve upon the vanilla (flattened codes) decoding, with a 4 fold inference speedup. This brings inference speed close to that of the previous state of the art (delay strategy). For the same inference efficiency budget the proposed approach outperforms in objective evaluations, almost closing the gap with vanilla quality-wise. The results are supported by spectral analysis and listening tests, which demonstrate that the samples produced by the new model exhibit improved high-frequency rendering and better maintenance of harmonics and rhythm patterns.","['https://openalex.org/W6849635556', 'https://openalex.org/W6852824296', 'https://openalex.org/W6853096648', 'https://openalex.org/W4401110409', 'https://openalex.org/W6854494257', 'https://openalex.org/W6795288823', 'https://openalex.org/W4313021454', 'https://openalex.org/W6850625674', 'https://openalex.org/W4307323391', 'https://openalex.org/W3215615641', 'https://openalex.org/W6769627184', 'https://openalex.org/W6848735303', 'https://openalex.org/W6853188576', 'https://openalex.org/W6845479124', 'https://openalex.org/W6849105126', 'https://openalex.org/W2526050071', 'https://openalex.org/W4288089799', 'https://openalex.org/W4313679638', 'https://openalex.org/W4319989813', 'https://openalex.org/W3162926177', 'https://openalex.org/W4383993968', 'https://openalex.org/W4378499140', 'https://openalex.org/W4318351475', 'https://openalex.org/W4322718191', 'https://openalex.org/W4380136719', 'https://openalex.org/W4377010126']",2024-03-18

However, most existing SLU models (1) suffer from the multi-modality problem that leads to reference intents and slots may not be suitable for training; (2) lack of alignment between the correct predictions of the two tasks, which extremely limits the overall accuracy. Therefore, in this paper, we propose Modifying the Reference via Reinforcement Learning (MRRL), a novel method for multiple intent detection and slot filling, which introduces a modifier and employs reinforcement learning. Specifically, we try to provide the better training target for the non-autoregressive SLU model via modifying the reference based on the output of the non-autoregressive SLU model, and propose a suitability reward to ensure that the output of the modifier module could fit well with the output of the non-autoregressive SLU model and does not deviate too far from the reference. In addition, we also propose a compromise reward to realize a flexible trade-off between the two subtasks. Experiments on two multi-intent datasets and non-autoregressive baselines demonstrate that our MRRL could consistently improve the performance of baselines. More encouragingly, our best variant achieves new state-of-the-art results, outperforming the previous best approach by 3.6 overall accuracy on MixATIS dataset.","['https://openalex.org/W2581637843', 'https://openalex.org/W3161463965', 'https://openalex.org/W4389520437', 'https://openalex.org/W3103899394', 'https://openalex.org/W3034216012', 'https://openalex.org/W3161631007', 'https://openalex.org/W648947103', 'https://openalex.org/W4312426068', 'https://openalex.org/W3209239055', 'https://openalex.org/W4384807869', 'https://openalex.org/W4297733535', 'https://openalex.org/W4382202516', 'https://openalex.org/W4382202608', 'https://openalex.org/W3098800734', 'https://openalex.org/W4386384714', 'https://openalex.org/W4387848696', 'https://openalex.org/W3173794693', 'https://openalex.org/W3099757670', 'https://openalex.org/W2963974889', 'https://openalex.org/W2804945011', 'https://openalex.org/W2963034998', 'https://openalex.org/W4385572615', 'https://openalex.org/W3212491726', 'https://openalex.org/W3170264707', 'https://openalex.org/W2963066655', 'https://openalex.org/W4385571399', 'https://openalex.org/W4378718233', 'https://openalex.org/W3100532071', 'https://openalex.org/W2474111273', 'https://openalex.org/W4224212267', 'https://openalex.org/W4385822432', 'https://openalex.org/W4389519101', 'https://openalex.org/W4238557920', 'https://openalex.org/W4288090877', 'https://openalex.org/W3113593351', 'https://openalex.org/W3162342118', 'https://openalex.org/W4385573070', 'https://openalex.org/W2077302143', 'https://openalex.org/W4298093396', 'https://openalex.org/W4385567042', 'https://openalex.org/W2898637464', 'https://openalex.org/W2888442053', 'https://openalex.org/W4385570101', 'https://openalex.org/W4385567178', 'https://openalex.org/W1522301498', 'https://openalex.org/W2888921503', 'https://openalex.org/W2970450228', 'https://openalex.org/W2971167298', 'https://openalex.org/W4297683418', 'https://openalex.org/W4375868795', 'https://openalex.org/W4385823351', 'https://openalex.org/W2963167310', 'https://openalex.org/W2964071174', 'https://openalex.org/W4382119366', 'https://openalex.org/W4285217170', 'https://openalex.org/W2766371743', 'https://openalex.org/W2803392141', 'https://openalex.org/W4389520050', 'https://openalex.org/W2094472029', 'https://openalex.org/W4287887858', 'https://openalex.org/W3093528669', 'https://openalex.org/W2119717200', 'https://openalex.org/W4224933765', 'https://openalex.org/W2473329891', 'https://openalex.org/W4288346477', 'https://openalex.org/W2946085385', 'https://openalex.org/W1975244201']",2023-01-01

Secondly, carefully extracting text from these submitted photos using py-tesseract. Using the Levenshtein distance measure, and then compared with the ground truth to determine correctness. This metric measures the accuracy of the text output through looking at the slight variations between the word error rate (WER) and character error rate (CER). This is capable of finding misspelled words and unknown characters providing a precise evaluation of the OCR's effectiveness.

These features give large performance improvements on tonal languages for ASR systems, and even substantial improvements for non-tonal languages. Our method, which we are calling the Kaldi pitch tracker (because we are adding it to the Kaldi ASR toolkit), is a highly modified version of the getf0 (RAPT) algorithm. Unlike the original getf0 we do not make a hard decision whether any given frame is voiced or unvoiced; instead, we assign a pitch even to unvoiced frames while constraining the pitch trajectory to be continuous. Our algorithm also produces a quantity that can be used as a probability of voicing measure; it is based on the normalized autocorrelation measure that our pitch extractor uses. We present results on data from various languages in the BABEL project, and show a large improvement over systems without tonal features and systems where pitch and POV information was obtained from SAcC or getf0.","['https://openalex.org/W2125234026', 'https://openalex.org/W6679097437', 'https://openalex.org/W6718561954', 'https://openalex.org/W1981706894', 'https://openalex.org/W2091425152', 'https://openalex.org/W6631362777', 'https://openalex.org/W2089537772', 'https://openalex.org/W3141523618', 'https://openalex.org/W1975079546', 'https://openalex.org/W2119599673', 'https://openalex.org/W2135431242', 'https://openalex.org/W23669922', 'https://openalex.org/W1524333225', 'https://openalex.org/W2442329935', 'https://openalex.org/W1571901760', 'https://openalex.org/W2129070077', 'https://openalex.org/W2115098197']",2014-05-01
https://openalex.org/W3217345456,https://doi.org/10.48550/arxiv.2111.14822,Vector Quantized Diffusion Model for Text-to-Image Synthesis,"We present the vector quantized diffusion (VQ-Diffusion) model for text-to-image generation. This method is based on a vector quantized variational autoencoder (VQ-VAE) whose latent space is modeled by a conditional variant of the recently developed Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM). We find that this latent-space method is well-suited for text-to-image generation tasks because it not only eliminates the unidirectional bias with existing methods but also allows us to incorporate a mask-and-replace diffusion strategy to avoid the accumulation of errors, which is a serious problem with existing methods. Our experiments show that the VQ-Diffusion produces significantly better text-to-image generation results when compared with conventional autoregressive (AR) models with similar numbers of parameters. Compared with previous GAN-based text-to-image methods, our VQ-Diffusion can handle more complex scenes and improve the synthesized image quality by a large margin. Finally, we show that the image generation computation in our method can be made highly efficient by reparameterization. With traditional AR methods, the text-to-image generation time increases linearly with the output image resolution and hence is quite time consuming even for normal size images. The VQ-Diffusion allows us to achieve a better trade-off between quality and speed. Our experiments indicate that the VQ-Diffusion model with the reparameterization is fifteen times faster than traditional AR methods while achieving a better image quality.","['https://openalex.org/W2964216930', 'https://openalex.org/W3135367836', 'https://openalex.org/W3169403647', 'https://openalex.org/W2964122153', 'https://openalex.org/W3036167779', 'https://openalex.org/W3009811209', 'https://openalex.org/W2108598243', 'https://openalex.org/W2963341956', 'https://openalex.org/W3155072588', 'https://openalex.org/W2788191623', 'https://openalex.org/W3129576130', 'https://openalex.org/W2904367110', 'https://openalex.org/W2972328244', 'https://openalex.org/W2962784628', 'https://openalex.org/W2963799213', 'https://openalex.org/W2886641317', 'https://openalex.org/W2598991778', 'https://openalex.org/W3175528029', 'https://openalex.org/W2950739196', 'https://openalex.org/W3048484056', 'https://openalex.org/W3165647589', 'https://openalex.org/W2949999304', 'https://openalex.org/W3019065799', 'https://openalex.org/W2893749619', 'https://openalex.org/W2950009906', 'https://openalex.org/W3122887982', 'https://openalex.org/W3181640983', 'https://openalex.org/W3134582802', 'https://openalex.org/W3096601784', 'https://openalex.org/W2788768663', 'https://openalex.org/W2626778328', 'https://openalex.org/W2979214993', 'https://openalex.org/W3111551570', 'https://openalex.org/W3196163807', 'https://openalex.org/W1797268635', 'https://openalex.org/W3176641147', 'https://openalex.org/W3162926177', 'https://openalex.org/W2950541952', 'https://openalex.org/W3209532394', 'https://openalex.org/W3030163527']",2021-11-29

Transformer models are good at capturing content-based global interactions, while CNNs exploit local features effectively. In this work, we achieve the best of both worlds by studying how to combine convolution neural networks and transformers to model both local and global dependencies of an audio sequence in a parameter-efficient way. To this regard, we propose the convolution-augmented transformer for speech recognition, named Conformer. Conformer significantly outperforms the previous Transformer and CNN based models achieving state-of-the-art accuracies. On the widely used LibriSpeech benchmark, our model achieves WER of 2.1%/4.3% without using a language model and 1.9%/3.9% with an external language model on test/testother. We also observe competitive performance of 2.7%/6.3% with a small model of only 10M parameters.","['https://openalex.org/W1964175594', 'https://openalex.org/W3021469861', 'https://openalex.org/W2767286248', 'https://openalex.org/W1828163288', 'https://openalex.org/W2952180055', 'https://openalex.org/W3016010032', 'https://openalex.org/W3015194534', 'https://openalex.org/W2937843571', 'https://openalex.org/W2979636403', 'https://openalex.org/W2932319281', 'https://openalex.org/W2892009249', 'https://openalex.org/W2908336025', 'https://openalex.org/W2963970792', 'https://openalex.org/W2964110616', 'https://openalex.org/W2095705004', 'https://openalex.org/W2928941594', 'https://openalex.org/W2936774411', 'https://openalex.org/W2994771587', 'https://openalex.org/W2963542740', 'https://openalex.org/W2963420686', 'https://openalex.org/W2626778328', 'https://openalex.org/W2981413347', 'https://openalex.org/W2962760690', 'https://openalex.org/W1522301498', 'https://openalex.org/W2112739286', 'https://openalex.org/W1995562189', 'https://openalex.org/W3019527251', 'https://openalex.org/W2798858969', 'https://openalex.org/W2981857663', 'https://openalex.org/W2972818416', 'https://openalex.org/W1494198834', 'https://openalex.org/W2963414781', 'https://openalex.org/W2981581604', 'https://openalex.org/W2948981900']",2020-05-16

To deal with these three problems, we propose the Hidden-Unit BERT (HuBERT) approach for self-supervised speech representation learning, which utilizes an offline clustering step to provide aligned target labels for a BERT-like prediction loss. A key ingredient of our approach is applying the prediction loss over the masked regions only, which forces the model to learn a combined acoustic and language model over the continuous inputs. HuBERT relies primarily on the consistency of the unsupervised clustering step rather than the intrinsic quality of the assigned cluster labels. Starting with a simple k-means teacher of 100 clusters, and using two iterations of clustering, the HuBERT model either matches or improves upon the state-of-the-art wav2vec 2.0 performance on the Librispeech (960h) and Libri-light (60,000h) benchmarks with 10min, 1h, 10h, 100h, and 960h fine-tuning subsets.

Despite the advantage, the parallel TTS models cannot be trained without guidance from autoregressive TTS models as their external aligners. In this work, we propose Glow-TTS, a flow-based generative model for parallel TTS that does not require any external aligner. By combining the properties of flows and dynamic programming, the proposed model searches for the most probable monotonic alignment between text and the latent representation of speech on its own. We demonstrate that enforcing hard monotonic alignments enables robust TTS, which generalizes to long utterances, and employing generative flows enables fast, diverse, and controllable speech synthesis. Glow-TTS obtains an order-of-magnitude speed-up over the autoregressive model, Tacotron 2, at synthesis with comparable speech quality.

In this paper we introduce Grad-TTS, a novel text-to-speech model with score-based decoder producing mel-spectrograms by gradually transforming noise predicted by encoder and aligned with text input by means of Monotonic Alignment Search. The framework of stochastic differential equations helps us to generalize conventional diffusion probabilistic models to the case of reconstructing data from noise with different parameters and allows to make this reconstruction flexible by explicitly controlling trade-off between sound quality and inference speed. Subjective human evaluation shows that Grad-TTS is competitive with state-of-the-art text-to-speech approaches in terms of Mean Opinion Score. We will make the code publicly available shortly.","['https://openalex.org/W2963782041', 'https://openalex.org/W2996286887', 'https://openalex.org/W2970006822', 'https://openalex.org/W2125838338', 'https://openalex.org/W1901129140', 'https://openalex.org/W3121345697', 'https://openalex.org/W2963755523', 'https://openalex.org/W3015338123', 'https://openalex.org/W2970730223', 'https://openalex.org/W3098403858', 'https://openalex.org/W2519091744', 'https://openalex.org/W2964243274', 'https://openalex.org/W3105013723', 'https://openalex.org/W3125708547', 'https://openalex.org/W3108645709', 'https://openalex.org/W2971034910', 'https://openalex.org/W2099471712', 'https://openalex.org/W3093733783', 'https://openalex.org/W2963090522', 'https://openalex.org/W3129651364', 'https://openalex.org/W2903739847', 'https://openalex.org/W2962879692', 'https://openalex.org/W3100572490', 'https://openalex.org/W3123097577', 'https://openalex.org/W2129069237', 'https://openalex.org/W3091928890', 'https://openalex.org/W1991111872', 'https://openalex.org/W2963300588', 'https://openalex.org/W2963139417', 'https://openalex.org/W3098304089', 'https://openalex.org/W3099788458']",2021-05-13

The DNN, which is trained to discriminate between speakers, maps variable-length utterances to fixed-dimensional embeddings that we call x-vectors. Prior studies have found that embeddings leverage large-scale training datasets better than i-vectors. However, it can be challenging to collect substantial quantities of labeled data for training. We use data augmentation, consisting of added noise and reverberation, as an inexpensive method to multiply the amount of training data and improve robustness. The x-vectors are compared with i-vector baselines on Speakers in the Wild and NIST SRE 2016 Cantonese. We find that while augmentation is beneficial in the PLDA classifier, it is not helpful in the i-vector extractor. However, the x-vector DNN effectively exploits data augmentation, due to its supervised training. As a result, the x-vectors achieve superior performance on the evaluation datasets.","['https://openalex.org/W2004497042', 'https://openalex.org/W2290689761', 'https://openalex.org/W2964228006', 'https://openalex.org/W2114925438', 'https://openalex.org/W6601610752', 'https://openalex.org/W2138547132', 'https://openalex.org/W2587150483', 'https://openalex.org/W2584329820', 'https://openalex.org/W2726515241', 'https://openalex.org/W2129066450', 'https://openalex.org/W6713727690', 'https://openalex.org/W2586741466', 'https://openalex.org/W1589137271', 'https://openalex.org/W2395750323', 'https://openalex.org/W2129379984', 'https://openalex.org/W2183016404', 'https://openalex.org/W2039057510', 'https://openalex.org/W2150769028', 'https://openalex.org/W1528954144', 'https://openalex.org/W2748488820', 'https://openalex.org/W2747238065', 'https://openalex.org/W6675123034', 'https://openalex.org/W6631362777', 'https://openalex.org/W6725862793', 'https://openalex.org/W2696967604', 'https://openalex.org/W2516631658', 'https://openalex.org/W2406312423', 'https://openalex.org/W2219249508', 'https://openalex.org/W2294814385', 'https://openalex.org/W1524333225', 'https://openalex.org/W3186851455', 'https://openalex.org/W2101556109', 'https://openalex.org/W2109761419', 'https://openalex.org/W40124310']",2018-04-01

By combining two types of discrete speech representations, we cast TTS as a composition of two sequence-to-sequence tasks: from text to high-level semantic tokens (akin to “reading”) and from semantic tokens to low-level acoustic tokens (“speaking”). Decoupling these two tasks enables training of the “speaking” module using abundant audio-only data, and unlocks the highly efficient combination of pretraining and backtranslation to reduce the need for parallel data when training the “reading” component. To control the speaker identity, we adopt example prompting, which allows SPEAR-TTS to generalize to unseen speakers using only a short sample of 3 seconds, without any explicit speaker representation or speaker labels. Our experiments demonstrate that SPEAR-TTS achieves a character error rate that is competitive with state-of-the-art methods using only 15 minutes of parallel data, while matching ground-truth speech in naturalness and acoustic quality.","['https://openalex.org/W6849105126', 'https://openalex.org/W3205644108', 'https://openalex.org/W4381786045', 'https://openalex.org/W6778883912', 'https://openalex.org/W6805710207', 'https://openalex.org/W3209984917', 'https://openalex.org/W4226033575', 'https://openalex.org/W6800767084', 'https://openalex.org/W2889326796', 'https://openalex.org/W6638667902', 'https://openalex.org/W6917585676', 'https://openalex.org/W4380874786', 'https://openalex.org/W2995181338', 'https://openalex.org/W3198217962', 'https://openalex.org/W6804184754', 'https://openalex.org/W6849956205', 'https://openalex.org/W6783867762', 'https://openalex.org/W4385574033', 'https://openalex.org/W6790356757', 'https://openalex.org/W4296068981', 'https://openalex.org/W3034999214', 'https://openalex.org/W6810406373', 'https://openalex.org/W3015419784', 'https://openalex.org/W4307680525', 'https://openalex.org/W1494198834', 'https://openalex.org/W4285182272', 'https://openalex.org/W3140429000', 'https://openalex.org/W6769627184', 'https://openalex.org/W3161480375', 'https://openalex.org/W3033411150', 'https://openalex.org/W3016181583', 'https://openalex.org/W6853998256', 'https://openalex.org/W2963216553', 'https://openalex.org/W6751104502', 'https://openalex.org/W2964243274', 'https://openalex.org/W6677920722', 'https://openalex.org/W6739901393', 'https://openalex.org/W6848735303', 'https://openalex.org/W3215615641', 'https://openalex.org/W2972359262', 'https://openalex.org/W4394671563', 'https://openalex.org/W4288089799', 'https://openalex.org/W4381827575', 'https://openalex.org/W4296070453', 'https://openalex.org/W4320459320', 'https://openalex.org/W4318351475', 'https://openalex.org/W4385245566', 'https://openalex.org/W3198123200', 'https://openalex.org/W3215895588', 'https://openalex.org/W3092028330', 'https://openalex.org/W4313679638', 'https://openalex.org/W4292779060']",2023-01-01

Current large TTS systems usually quantize speech into discrete tokens and use language models to generate these tokens one by one, which suffer from unstable prosody, word skipping/repeating issue, and poor voice quality. In this paper, we develop NaturalSpeech 2, a TTS system that leverages a neural audio codec with residual vector quantizers to get the quantized latent vectors and uses a diffusion model to generate these latent vectors conditioned on text input. To enhance the zero-shot capability that is important to achieve diverse speech synthesis, we design a speech prompting mechanism to facilitate in-context learning in the diffusion model and the duration/pitch predictor. We scale NaturalSpeech 2 to large-scale datasets with 44K hours of speech and singing data and evaluate its voice quality on unseen speakers. NaturalSpeech 2 outperforms previous TTS systems by a large margin in terms of prosody/timbre similarity, robustness, and voice quality in a zero-shot setting, and performs novel zero-shot singing synthesis with only a speech prompt.

Nowadays, there are two common ways to control speaking styles: (1) Pre-defining a group of speaking style and using categorical index to denote different speaking style. However, there are limitations in the diversity of expressiveness, as these models can only generate the pre-defined styles. (2) Using reference speech as style input, which results in a problem that the extracted style information is not intuitive or interpretable. In this study, we attempt to use natural language as style prompt to control the styles in the synthetic speech, e.g., ""Sigh tone in full of sad mood with some helpless feeling"". Considering that there is no existing TTS corpus which is proper to benchmark this novel task, we first construct a speech corpus, whose speech samples are annotated with not only content transcriptions but also style descriptions in natural language. Then we propose an expressive TTS model, named as InstructTTS, which is novel in the sense of following aspects: (1) We fully take the advantage of self-supervised learning and cross-modal metric learning, and propose a novel three-stage training procedure to obtain a robust sentence embedding model, which can effectively capture semantic information from the style prompts and control the speaking style in the generated speech. (2) We propose to model acoustic features in discrete latent space and train a novel discrete diffusion probabilistic model to generate vector-quantized (VQ) acoustic tokens rather than the commonly-used mel spectrogram. (3) We jointly apply mutual information (MI) estimation and minimization during acoustic model training to minimize style-speaker and style-content MI, avoiding possible content and speaker information leakage from the style prompt.",[],2023-01-31
https://openalex.org/W1522301498,https://doi.org/10.48550/arxiv.1412.6980,Adam: A Method for Stochastic Optimization,"We introduce Adam, an algorithm for first-order gradient-based optimization of stochastic objective functions, based on adaptive estimates of lower-order moments. The method is straightforward to implement, is computationally efficient, has little memory requirements, is invariant to diagonal rescaling of the gradients, and is well suited for problems that are large in terms of data and/or parameters. The method is also appropriate for non-stationary objectives and problems with very noisy and/or sparse gradients. The hyper-parameters have intuitive interpretations and typically require little tuning. Some connections to related algorithms, on which Adam was inspired, are discussed. We also analyze the theoretical convergence properties of the algorithm and provide a regret bound on the convergence rate that is comparable to the best known results under the online convex optimization framework. Empirical results demonstrate that Adam works well in practice and compares favorably to other stochastic optimization methods. Finally, we discuss AdaMax, a variant of Adam based on the infinity norm.","['https://openalex.org/W1984541135', 'https://openalex.org/W6908809', 'https://openalex.org/W2100495367', 'https://openalex.org/W1810943226', 'https://openalex.org/W35527955', 'https://openalex.org/W2143612262', 'https://openalex.org/W104184427', 'https://openalex.org/W1904365287', 'https://openalex.org/W2113459411', 'https://openalex.org/W2950351588', 'https://openalex.org/W59018853', 'https://openalex.org/W2146502635', 'https://openalex.org/W2160815625', 'https://openalex.org/W3176583243', 'https://openalex.org/W2156779765', 'https://openalex.org/W2148825261', 'https://openalex.org/W2951004968', 'https://openalex.org/W1598497354', 'https://openalex.org/W1491468723', 'https://openalex.org/W2086161653']",2014-12-22

Flowtron borrows insights from IAF and revamps Tacotron in order to provide high-quality and expressive mel-spectrogram synthesis. Flowtron is optimized by maximizing the likelihood of the training data, which makes training simple and stable. Flowtron learns an invertible mapping of data to a latent space that can be manipulated to control many aspects of speech synthesis (pitch, tone, speech rate, cadence, accent). Our mean opinion scores (MOS) show that Flowtron matches state-of-the-art TTS models in terms of speech quality. In addition, we provide results on control of speech variation, interpolation between samples and style transfer between speakers seen and unseen during training.

In contrast to existing MLM-based speech pre-training frameworks such as HuBERT, which relies on an iterative re-clustering and re-training process, or vq-wav2vec, which concatenates two separately trained modules, w2v-BERT can be optimized in an end-to-end fashion by solving the two self-supervised tasks (the contrastive task and MLM) simultaneously. Our experiments show that w2v-BERT achieves competitive results compared to current state-of-the-art pre-trained models on the LibriSpeech benchmarks when using the Libri-Light 60k corpus as the unsupervised data. In particular, when compared to published models such as conformer-based wav2vec 2.0 and HuBERT, our model shows 5% to 10% relative WER reduction on the test-clean and test-other subsets. When applied to the Google's Voice Search traffic dataset, w2v-BERT outperforms our internal conformer-based wav2vec 2.0 by more than 30% relatively.","['https://openalex.org/W2936774411', 'https://openalex.org/W6751104502', 'https://openalex.org/W6638667902', 'https://openalex.org/W6746023985', 'https://openalex.org/W2064675550', 'https://openalex.org/W6638749077', 'https://openalex.org/W6631190155', 'https://openalex.org/W2121879602', 'https://openalex.org/W1494198834', 'https://openalex.org/W6771812881', 'https://openalex.org/W2842511635', 'https://openalex.org/W3015995734', 'https://openalex.org/W2972943112', 'https://openalex.org/W2973049979', 'https://openalex.org/W3015265920', 'https://openalex.org/W3016011332', 'https://openalex.org/W2982223350', 'https://openalex.org/W3035202887', 'https://openalex.org/W3041561163', 'https://openalex.org/W3003875258', 'https://openalex.org/W6786669483', 'https://openalex.org/W6739901393', 'https://openalex.org/W3015522062', 'https://openalex.org/W6770514103', 'https://openalex.org/W2111316763', 'https://openalex.org/W2940322076', 'https://openalex.org/W3097777922', 'https://openalex.org/W6770506093', 'https://openalex.org/W165878654', 'https://openalex.org/W2928408492', 'https://openalex.org/W2101210369', 'https://openalex.org/W2088622183', 'https://openalex.org/W6784532283', 'https://openalex.org/W3160525311', 'https://openalex.org/W3093579165', 'https://openalex.org/W3157697407', 'https://openalex.org/W6755207826', 'https://openalex.org/W3026041220', 'https://openalex.org/W6780218876', 'https://openalex.org/W6769196770', 'https://openalex.org/W3209059054', 'https://openalex.org/W4385245566', 'https://openalex.org/W4293569541', 'https://openalex.org/W1522301498', 'https://openalex.org/W2988736778', 'https://openalex.org/W4320930577', 'https://openalex.org/W3128768055', 'https://openalex.org/W2979476256', 'https://openalex.org/W1836465849', 'https://openalex.org/W3112034174', 'https://openalex.org/W2991213871', 'https://openalex.org/W2962907457', 'https://openalex.org/W3036601975', 'https://openalex.org/W2995181338', 'https://openalex.org/W4210463634', 'https://openalex.org/W2896457183', 'https://openalex.org/W1828163288', 'https://openalex.org/W4297808394']",2021-12-13
https://openalex.org/W3033411150,https://doi.org/10.57702/v7a23pbp,FastSpeech 2: Fast and High-Quality End-to-End Text-to-Speech,"Non-autoregressive text to speech (TTS) models such as FastSpeech can synthesize speech significantly faster than previous autoregressive models with comparable quality. The training of FastSpeech model relies on an autoregressive teacher model for duration prediction (to provide more information as input) and knowledge distillation (to simplify the data distribution in output), which can ease the one-to-many mapping problem (i.e., multiple speech variations correspond to the same text) in TTS. However, FastSpeech has several disadvantages: 1) the teacher-student distillation pipeline is complicated and time-consuming, 2) the duration extracted from the teacher model is not accurate enough, and the target mel-spectrograms distilled from teacher model suffer from information loss due to data simplification, both of which limit the voice quality. In this paper, we propose FastSpeech 2, which addresses the issues in FastSpeech and better solves the one-to-many mapping problem in TTS by 1) directly training the model with ground-truth target instead of the simplified output from teacher, and 2) introducing more variation information of speech (e.g., pitch, energy and more accurate duration) as conditional inputs. Specifically, we extract duration, pitch and energy from speech waveform and directly take them as conditional inputs in training and use predicted values in inference. We further design FastSpeech 2s, which is the first attempt to directly generate speech waveform from text in parallel, enjoying the benefit of fully end-to-end inference. Experimental results show that 1) FastSpeech 2 achieves a 3x training speed-up over FastSpeech, and FastSpeech 2s enjoys even faster inference speed; 2) FastSpeech 2 and 2s outperform FastSpeech in voice quality, and FastSpeech 2 can even surpass autoregressive models.

AudioLM maps the input audio to a sequence of discrete tokens and casts audio generation as a language modeling task in this representation space. We show how existing audio tokenizers provide different trade-offs between reconstruction quality and long-term structure, and we propose a hybrid tokenization scheme to achieve both objectives. Namely, we leverage the discretized activations of a masked language model pre-trained on audio to capture long-term structure and the discrete codes produced by a neural audio codec to achieve high-quality synthesis. By training on large corpora of raw audio waveforms, AudioLM learns to generate natural and coherent continuations given short prompts. When trained on speech, and without any transcript or annotation, AudioLM generates syntactically and semantically plausible speech continuations while also maintaining speaker identity and prosody for unseen speakers. Furthermore, we demonstrate how our approach extends beyond speech by generating coherent piano music continuations, despite being trained without any symbolic representation of music.","['https://openalex.org/W3197259906', 'https://openalex.org/W6840487619', 'https://openalex.org/W6839643428', 'https://openalex.org/W3160799772', 'https://openalex.org/W6739901393', 'https://openalex.org/W6809593508', 'https://openalex.org/W6790356757', 'https://openalex.org/W4292825791', 'https://openalex.org/W2995181338', 'https://openalex.org/W6734901337', 'https://openalex.org/W6802517614', 'https://openalex.org/W3148101939', 'https://openalex.org/W6810081322', 'https://openalex.org/W1494198834', 'https://openalex.org/W4226033575', 'https://openalex.org/W3215615641', 'https://openalex.org/W6755207826', 'https://openalex.org/W2395899413', 'https://openalex.org/W3037038648', 'https://openalex.org/W4287887366', 'https://openalex.org/W3198217962', 'https://openalex.org/W4296068815', 'https://openalex.org/W3097777922', 'https://openalex.org/W3180355996', 'https://openalex.org/W6810311916', 'https://openalex.org/W6776218486', 'https://openalex.org/W4312633146', 'https://openalex.org/W1728888090', 'https://openalex.org/W6778883912', 'https://openalex.org/W6782760101', 'https://openalex.org/W6783867762', 'https://openalex.org/W6767111847', 'https://openalex.org/W6783182287', 'https://openalex.org/W3095095816', 'https://openalex.org/W6783944145', 'https://openalex.org/W4226380987', 'https://openalex.org/W6771324808', 'https://openalex.org/W6798182279', 'https://openalex.org/W3144810982', 'https://openalex.org/W3162391496', 'https://openalex.org/W3209059054', 'https://openalex.org/W6769196770', 'https://openalex.org/W6748409065', 'https://openalex.org/W3131922516', 'https://openalex.org/W6769627184', 'https://openalex.org/W6735849998', 'https://openalex.org/W6762931180', 'https://openalex.org/W2972354707', 'https://openalex.org/W2963182577', 'https://openalex.org/W6843673214', 'https://openalex.org/W6805710207', 'https://openalex.org/W6800767084', 'https://openalex.org/W2752796333', 'https://openalex.org/W6768435317', 'https://openalex.org/W6844194202', 'https://openalex.org/W3186609711', 'https://openalex.org/W6780218876', 'https://openalex.org/W6755182157', 'https://openalex.org/W3198815374', 'https://openalex.org/W4292779060', 'https://openalex.org/W4283388932', 'https://openalex.org/W2604231067', 'https://openalex.org/W4221161768', 'https://openalex.org/W2896457183', 'https://openalex.org/W2996286887', 'https://openalex.org/W2519091744', 'https://openalex.org/W4224308101', 'https://openalex.org/W2995359496', 'https://openalex.org/W4288348042', 'https://openalex.org/W3123097577', 'https://openalex.org/W2963799213', 'https://openalex.org/W4287802874', 'https://openalex.org/W2950547518', 'https://openalex.org/W3129651364', 'https://openalex.org/W4385245566', 'https://openalex.org/W3092028330', 'https://openalex.org/W3177813494', 'https://openalex.org/W2979476256', 'https://openalex.org/W3206395542', 'https://openalex.org/W2593779438', 'https://openalex.org/W4226275767', 'https://openalex.org/W2970006822', 'https://openalex.org/W4309793872', 'https://openalex.org/W3036601975', 'https://openalex.org/W4225680573', 'https://openalex.org/W4394671563', 'https://openalex.org/W4288089799', 'https://openalex.org/W3198123200', 'https://openalex.org/W4294619240', 'https://openalex.org/W4298580827', 'https://openalex.org/W2971074500', 'https://openalex.org/W4297808394']",2023-01-01

The system is composed of a recurrent sequence-to-sequence feature prediction network that maps character embeddings to mel-scale spectrograms, followed by a modified WaveNet model acting as a vocoder to synthesize time-domain waveforms from those spectrograms. Our model achieves a mean opinion score (MOS) of 4.53 comparable to a MOS of 4.58 for professionally recorded speech. To validate our design choices, we present ablation studies of key components of our system and evaluate the impact of using mel spectrograms as the conditioning input to WaveNet instead of linguistic, duration, and F0 features. We further show that using this compact acoustic intermediate representation allows for a significant reduction in the size of the WaveNet architecture.","['https://openalex.org/W2964301388', 'https://openalex.org/W2507771204', 'https://openalex.org/W6738277540', 'https://openalex.org/W6745697700', 'https://openalex.org/W2963609956', 'https://openalex.org/W6679436768', 'https://openalex.org/W2120847449', 'https://openalex.org/W2749651610', 'https://openalex.org/W6756197946', 'https://openalex.org/W2148154194', 'https://openalex.org/W6638667902', 'https://openalex.org/W2131774270', 'https://openalex.org/W2769810959', 'https://openalex.org/W2154920538', 'https://openalex.org/W6635953567', 'https://openalex.org/W6675380101', 'https://openalex.org/W6631190155', 'https://openalex.org/W2129142580', 'https://openalex.org/W2111284386', 'https://openalex.org/W2150658333', 'https://openalex.org/W6734815144', 'https://openalex.org/W1570629387', 'https://openalex.org/W2064675550', 'https://openalex.org/W6679434410', 'https://openalex.org/W6623517193', 'https://openalex.org/W6634817459', 'https://openalex.org/W6714142977', 'https://openalex.org/W6674330103', 'https://openalex.org/W2095705004', 'https://openalex.org/W1836465849', 'https://openalex.org/W2591927543', 'https://openalex.org/W4293714597', 'https://openalex.org/W2519091744', 'https://openalex.org/W2619368999', 'https://openalex.org/W854541894', 'https://openalex.org/W2102003408', 'https://openalex.org/W1579853615', 'https://openalex.org/W2766812927', 'https://openalex.org/W2901997113', 'https://openalex.org/W4294619240', 'https://openalex.org/W1599623585', 'https://openalex.org/W1522301498', 'https://openalex.org/W2133564696', 'https://openalex.org/W2130942839']",2018-04-01

However, standard LLMs may ignore crucial paralinguistic information, such as sentiment, emotion, and speaking style, which are essential for achieving natural, human-like spoken conversation, especially when such information is conveyed by acoustic cues. We therefore propose Paralinguistics-enhanced Generative Pretrained Transformer (ParalinGPT), an LLM that utilizes text and speech modalities to better model the linguistic content and paralinguistic attributes of spoken dialogue. The model takes the conversational context of text, speech embeddings, and paralinguistic attributes as input prompts within a serialized multitasking multimodal framework. Specifically, our framework serializes tasks in the order of current paralinguistic attribute prediction, response paralinguistic attribute prediction, and response text generation with autoregressive conditioning. We utilize the Switchboard-1 corpus, including its sentiment labels as the paralinguistic attribute, as our spoken dialogue dataset. Experimental results indicate the proposed serialized multitasking method outperforms typical sequence classification techniques on current and response sentiment classification. Furthermore, leveraging conversational context and speech embeddings significantly improves both response text generation and sentiment prediction. Our proposed framework achieves relative improvements of 6.7%, 12.0%, and 3.5% in current sentiment accuracy, response sentiment accuracy, and response text BLEU score, respectively.","['https://openalex.org/W6851678396', 'https://openalex.org/W6763494226', 'https://openalex.org/W2766833041', 'https://openalex.org/W4293714393', 'https://openalex.org/W2952088495', 'https://openalex.org/W3048664667', 'https://openalex.org/W3153025627', 'https://openalex.org/W3174716116', 'https://openalex.org/W2128970689', 'https://openalex.org/W2151083697', 'https://openalex.org/W2897636448', 'https://openalex.org/W6804073865', 'https://openalex.org/W4285273040', 'https://openalex.org/W2936162287', 'https://openalex.org/W6791303579', 'https://openalex.org/W2548264631', 'https://openalex.org/W2586286573', 'https://openalex.org/W4319862652', 'https://openalex.org/W2968228919', 'https://openalex.org/W3095607145', 'https://openalex.org/W4385823311', 'https://openalex.org/W6790356757', 'https://openalex.org/W3198217962', 'https://openalex.org/W4307680525', 'https://openalex.org/W4381786045', 'https://openalex.org/W6853998256', 'https://openalex.org/W4389524500', 'https://openalex.org/W3015489952', 'https://openalex.org/W3197236059', 'https://openalex.org/W6780218876', 'https://openalex.org/W3198771897', 'https://openalex.org/W4319862479', 'https://openalex.org/W2166637769', 'https://openalex.org/W6778490555', 'https://openalex.org/W4381827575', 'https://openalex.org/W3036601975', 'https://openalex.org/W4394671563', 'https://openalex.org/W3133903425', 'https://openalex.org/W4366559955', 'https://openalex.org/W3193377986', 'https://openalex.org/W4226422436']",2024-03-18

This is mostly achieved by following the VQ-VAE paradigm where blind features are learned, vector-quantized and coded. In this paper, instead of blind end-to-end learning, we propose to learn disentangled features for real-time neural speech coding. Specifically, more global-like speaker identity and local content features are learned with disentanglement to represent speech. Such a compact feature decomposition not only achieves better coding efficiency by exploiting bit allocation among different features but also provides the flexibility to do audio editing in embedding space, such as voice conversion in real-time communications. Both subjective and objective results demonstrate its coding efficiency and we find that the learned disentangled features show comparable performance on any-to-any voice conversion with modern self-supervised speech representation learning models with far less parameters and low latency, showing the potential of our neural coding framework.","['https://openalex.org/W2775336875', 'https://openalex.org/W2963208781', 'https://openalex.org/W3163662330', 'https://openalex.org/W2935711438', 'https://openalex.org/W3215615641', 'https://openalex.org/W4225287045', 'https://openalex.org/W3214758449', 'https://openalex.org/W2752796333', 'https://openalex.org/W3160584619', 'https://openalex.org/W3015434413', 'https://openalex.org/W3197659778', 'https://openalex.org/W2972659941', 'https://openalex.org/W3140429000', 'https://openalex.org/W3207018606', 'https://openalex.org/W6769196770', 'https://openalex.org/W1494198834', 'https://openalex.org/W3207300132', 'https://openalex.org/W3197580070', 'https://openalex.org/W4205788663', 'https://openalex.org/W2187089797', 'https://openalex.org/W2963799213']",2023-05-05

Solving this task using only audio as input is extremely challenging and does not provide an association of the separated speech signals with speakers in the video. In this paper, we present a deep network-based model that incorporates both visual and auditory signals to solve this task. The visual features are used to ""focus"" the audio on desired speakers in a scene and to improve the speech separation quality. To train our joint audio-visual model, we introduce AVS peech , a new dataset comprised of thousands of hours of video segments from the Web. We demonstrate the applicability of our method to classic speech separation tasks, as well as real-world scenarios involving heated interviews, noisy bars, and screaming children, only requiring the user to specify the face of the person in the video whose speech they want to isolate. Our method shows clear advantage over state-of-the-art audio-only speech separation in cases of mixed speech. In addition, our model, which is speaker-independent (trained once, applicable to any speaker), produces better results than recent audio-visual speech separation methods that are speaker-dependent (require training a separate model for each speaker of interest).","['https://openalex.org/W2168010845', 'https://openalex.org/W1991139021', 'https://openalex.org/W2598036111', 'https://openalex.org/W2963019222', 'https://openalex.org/W1482149378', 'https://openalex.org/W2735090526', 'https://openalex.org/W2963218389', 'https://openalex.org/W2593116425', 'https://openalex.org/W2081144555', 'https://openalex.org/W2029199293', 'https://openalex.org/W2128653983', 'https://openalex.org/W2221409856', 'https://openalex.org/W1976188834', 'https://openalex.org/W2788241093', 'https://openalex.org/W1964448421', 'https://openalex.org/W2088079940', 'https://openalex.org/W1971168548', 'https://openalex.org/W1503933356', 'https://openalex.org/W2962960500', 'https://openalex.org/W2148659689', 'https://openalex.org/W2660943524', 'https://openalex.org/W2167734090', 'https://openalex.org/W1552314771', 'https://openalex.org/W2311038409', 'https://openalex.org/W2605589342', 'https://openalex.org/W2067295501', 'https://openalex.org/W2101045344', 'https://openalex.org/W2127851351', 'https://openalex.org/W2069681747', 'https://openalex.org/W2532854561', 'https://openalex.org/W1897240248', 'https://openalex.org/W2460742184', 'https://openalex.org/W1849277567', 'https://openalex.org/W2962865004', 'https://openalex.org/W1899185266', 'https://openalex.org/W2525694994', 'https://openalex.org/W2952746495', 'https://openalex.org/W2101036994', 'https://openalex.org/W2796992393', 'https://openalex.org/W2962866211', 'https://openalex.org/W2495705551', 'https://openalex.org/W1836465849', 'https://openalex.org/W2099128937', 'https://openalex.org/W3127686677', 'https://openalex.org/W2963812294', 'https://openalex.org/W2750143381', 'https://openalex.org/W2771039075', 'https://openalex.org/W3105024549', 'https://openalex.org/W3105099157', 'https://openalex.org/W2621109248', 'https://openalex.org/W1496883935', 'https://openalex.org/W2730845691', 'https://openalex.org/W2184188583', 'https://openalex.org/W4302114989', 'https://openalex.org/W2962715207', 'https://openalex.org/W2556930864', 'https://openalex.org/W2964171275', 'https://openalex.org/W4307196995', 'https://openalex.org/W1755563775']",2018-07-30

https://openalex.org/W3081192838,https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1188976,The Ryerson Audio-Visual Database of Emotional Speech and Song (RAVDESS),"Description The Ryerson Audio-Visual Database of Emotional Speech and Song (RAVDESS) contains 7356 files (total size: 24.8 GB). The dataset contains 24 professional actors (12 female, 12 male), vocalizing two lexically-matched statements in a neutral North American accent. Speech includes calm, happy, sad, angry, fearful, surprise, and disgust expressions, and song contains calm, happy, sad, angry, and fearful emotions. Each expression is produced at two levels of emotional intensity (normal, strong), with an additional neutral expression. All conditions are available in three modality formats: Audio-only (16bit, 48kHz .wav), Audio-Video (720p H.264, AAC 48kHz, .mp4), and Video-only (no sound). Note, there are no song files for Actor_18. The RAVDESS was developed by Dr Steven R. Livingstone, who now leads the Affective Data Science Lab, and Dr Frank A. Russo who leads the SMART Lab.

Construction and Validation Full details on the construction and perceptual validation of the RAVDESS are described in our PLoS ONE paper - https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0196391. The RAVDESS contains 7356 files. Each file was rated 10 times on emotional validity, intensity, and genuineness. Ratings were provided by 247 individuals who were characteristic of untrained adult research participants from North America. A further set of 72 participants provided test-retest data. High levels of emotional validity, interrater reliability, and test-retest intrarater reliability were reported. Validation data is open-access, and can be downloaded along with our paper from PLoS ONE. Contents Audio-only files Audio-only files of all actors (01-24) are available as two separate zip files (~200 MB each): Speech file (Audio_Speech_Actors_01-24.zip, 215 MB) contains 1440 files: 60 trials per actor x 24 actors = 1440. Song file (Audio_Song_Actors_01-24.zip, 198 MB) contains 1012 files: 44 trials per actor x 23 actors = 1012. Audio-Visual and Video-only files Video files are provided as separate zip downloads for each actor (01-24, ~500 MB each), and are split into separate speech and song downloads: Speech files (Video_Speech_Actor_01.zip to Video_Speech_Actor_24.zip) collectively contains 2880 files: 60 trials per actor x 2 modalities (AV, VO) x 24 actors = 2880. Song files (Video_Song_Actor_01.zip to Video_Song_Actor_24.zip) collectively contains 2024 files: 44 trials per actor x 2 modalities (AV, VO) x 23 actors = 2024. File Summary In total, the RAVDESS collection includes 7356 files (2880+2024+1440+1012 files). File naming convention Each of the 7356 RAVDESS files has a unique filename. The filename consists of a 7-part numerical identifier (e.g., 02-01-06-01-02-01-12.mp4). These identifiers define the stimulus characteristics: Filename identifiers Modality (01 = full-AV, 02 = video-only, 03 = audio-only). Vocal channel (01 = speech, 02 = song). Emotion (01 = neutral, 02 = calm, 03 = happy, 04 = sad, 05 = angry, 06 = fearful, 07 = disgust, 08 = surprised). Emotional intensity (01 = normal, 02 = strong). NOTE: There is no strong intensity for the 'neutral' emotion. Statement (01 = ""Kids are talking by the door"", 02 = ""Dogs are sitting by the door""). Repetition (01 = 1st repetition, 02 = 2nd repetition). Actor (01 to 24. Odd numbered actors are male, even numbered actors are female).

In this work we demonstrate that a neural network architecture based on VQ-VAE with a WaveNet decoder can be used to perform very low bit-rate speech coding with high reconstruction quality. A prosody-transparent and speaker-independent model trained on the LibriSpeech corpus coding audio at 1.6 kbps exhibits perceptual quality which is around halfway between the MELP codec at 2.4 kbps and AMR-WB codec at 23.05 kbps. In addition, when training on high-quality recorded speech with the test speaker included in the training set, a model coding speech at 1.6 kbps produces output of similar perceptual quality to that generated by AMR-WB at 23.05 kbps.","['https://openalex.org/W2165291881', 'https://openalex.org/W2752796333', 'https://openalex.org/W6640963894', 'https://openalex.org/W1494198834', 'https://openalex.org/W6696768431', 'https://openalex.org/W2108532241', 'https://openalex.org/W6752888775', 'https://openalex.org/W6738494155', 'https://openalex.org/W6735849998', 'https://openalex.org/W2963182577', 'https://openalex.org/W2309400744', 'https://openalex.org/W2632564668', 'https://openalex.org/W2552465432', 'https://openalex.org/W6734035190', 'https://openalex.org/W2775336875', 'https://openalex.org/W6755135894', 'https://openalex.org/W2808706139', 'https://openalex.org/W2950237263', 'https://openalex.org/W2963799213', 'https://openalex.org/W1959608418', 'https://openalex.org/W2616159609', 'https://openalex.org/W4294567867', 'https://openalex.org/W2604231067', 'https://openalex.org/W2892620417', 'https://openalex.org/W2951004968', 'https://openalex.org/W2519091744', 'https://openalex.org/W2963449488', 'https://openalex.org/W2962676454', 'https://openalex.org/W3124456579', 'https://openalex.org/W2292235217']",2019-04-16

A GPE-VDE curve is then developed to show the trade-off between GPE and VDE. In addition, we introduce a model-based Unvoiced/Voiced (U/V) classification frontend which can be used by any F0 tracking algorithm. In the U/V classification, we train speaker independent U/V models, and then adapt them to speaker dependent models in an unsupervised fashion. The U/V classification result is taken as a mask for F0 tracking. Experiments using the KEELE corpus with additive noise show that our statistically-based U/V classifier can reduce VDE and FFE for the pitch tracker TEMPO in both white and babble noise conditions, and that minimizing FFE instead of VDE results in a reduction in error rates for a number of F0 tracking algorithms, especially in babble noise.","['https://openalex.org/W1974387177', 'https://openalex.org/W2151484683', 'https://openalex.org/W2146871184', 'https://openalex.org/W23669922', 'https://openalex.org/W2130086727', 'https://openalex.org/W2088632109', 'https://openalex.org/W4402490932', 'https://openalex.org/W2108819501', 'https://openalex.org/W147159200', 'https://openalex.org/W2091425152', 'https://openalex.org/W6639350448', 'https://openalex.org/W2171748469', 'https://openalex.org/W2129120544', 'https://openalex.org/W1875231349', 'https://openalex.org/W2141684970', 'https://openalex.org/W2084562624']",2009-04-01
