Yet, obtaining plans that are both feasible (grounded in affordances) and cost-effective (in plan length), remains a challenge, despite recent progress. This contrasts with heuristic planning methods that employ domain knowledge (formalized in action models such as PDDL) and heuristic search to generate feasible, optimal plans. Inspired by this, we propose to combine the power of LLMs and heuristic planning by leveraging the world knowledge of LLMs and the principles of heuristic search. Our approach, SayCanPay, employs LLMs to generate actions (Say) guided by learnable domain knowledge, that evaluates actions' feasibility (Can) and long-term reward/payoff (Pay), and heuristic search to select the best sequence of actions. Our contributions are (1) a novel framing of the LLM planning problem in the context of heuristic planning, (2) integrating grounding and cost-effective elements into the generated plans, and (3) using heuristic search over actions. Our extensive evaluations show that our model surpasses other LLM planning approaches.","['https://openalex.org/W6678231568', 'https://openalex.org/W2897513296', 'https://openalex.org/W2896457183', 'https://openalex.org/W4378767246', 'https://openalex.org/W6786039469', 'https://openalex.org/W4221152848', 'https://openalex.org/W2168359464', 'https://openalex.org/W6849548236', 'https://openalex.org/W3129009457', 'https://openalex.org/W2948589675', 'https://openalex.org/W4360819401', 'https://openalex.org/W2799002257', 'https://openalex.org/W2981852735', 'https://openalex.org/W4297161808', 'https://openalex.org/W3198685994', 'https://openalex.org/W3096099141', 'https://openalex.org/W4286336838', 'https://openalex.org/W4388660746', 'https://openalex.org/W4224912544', 'https://openalex.org/W4394671563', 'https://openalex.org/W4389520747', 'https://openalex.org/W3101355526', 'https://openalex.org/W4307934016', 'https://openalex.org/W4378509449', 'https://openalex.org/W4385473486', 'https://openalex.org/W4386251907', 'https://openalex.org/W4322718191', 'https://openalex.org/W4366999541', 'https://openalex.org/W4383108457', 'https://openalex.org/W4285428875', 'https://openalex.org/W4307079201', 'https://openalex.org/W4322825501', 'https://openalex.org/W4312045619', 'https://openalex.org/W4377130677', 'https://openalex.org/W4383097638', 'https://openalex.org/W4320559489', 'https://openalex.org/W4221158689', 'https://openalex.org/W4288089799', 'https://openalex.org/W4321011818', 'https://openalex.org/W2122054842', 'https://openalex.org/W4297808394', 'https://openalex.org/W4323066451', 'https://openalex.org/W4292119927', 'https://openalex.org/W2973379954', 'https://openalex.org/W3210940825']",2024-03-24

However, conventional assessments were performed by medical professionals in clinical settings, limiting persistent monitoring. We demonstrate feasibility of a ubiquitous monitoring system for autonomously detecting throat-related events utilizing a soft skin-attachable throat vibration sensor (STVS). The STVS accurately records throat vibrations without interference from surrounding noise, enabling measurement of subtle sounds such as swallowing. Out of the continuous data stream, we automatically classify events of interest using an ensemble-based deep learning model. The proposed model integrates multiple deep neural networks based on multi-modal acoustic features of throat-related events to enhance robustness and accuracy of classification. The performance of our model outperforms previous studies with a classification accuracy of 95.96%. These results show the potential of wearable solutions for improving dysphagia management and patient outcomes outside of clinical environments.","['https://openalex.org/W1967662809', 'https://openalex.org/W2971784612', 'https://openalex.org/W4385889130', 'https://openalex.org/W2188190481', 'https://openalex.org/W2100387032', 'https://openalex.org/W2162800226', 'https://openalex.org/W4385871822', 'https://openalex.org/W2981047412', 'https://openalex.org/W4390012088', 'https://openalex.org/W4296462521', 'https://openalex.org/W4327546431', 'https://openalex.org/W4389035980', 'https://openalex.org/W2990691150', 'https://openalex.org/W2805927228', 'https://openalex.org/W4386835103', 'https://openalex.org/W3161975008', 'https://openalex.org/W2769435864', 'https://openalex.org/W3185940864', 'https://openalex.org/W2891053383', 'https://openalex.org/W2990016708', 'https://openalex.org/W4316022315', 'https://openalex.org/W4400446910', 'https://openalex.org/W3155723493', 'https://openalex.org/W3186065429', 'https://openalex.org/W3161949382', 'https://openalex.org/W4399728170', 'https://openalex.org/W4200482780', 'https://openalex.org/W4200581517', 'https://openalex.org/W4280547844', 'https://openalex.org/W2507380695', 'https://openalex.org/W2151703098', 'https://openalex.org/W3149839747', 'https://openalex.org/W4385823180', 'https://openalex.org/W3129009457', 'https://openalex.org/W2943858543', 'https://openalex.org/W2004412381', 'https://openalex.org/W2791688502', 'https://openalex.org/W2148594799', 'https://openalex.org/W4310172534', 'https://openalex.org/W2194775991', 'https://openalex.org/W4309028162', 'https://openalex.org/W2962858109', 'https://openalex.org/W3166100196', 'https://openalex.org/W28412257', 'https://openalex.org/W2088794999', 'https://openalex.org/W2911964244', 'https://openalex.org/W2295598076', 'https://openalex.org/W2768348081', 'https://openalex.org/W2056132907', 'https://openalex.org/W1968969471', 'https://openalex.org/W2008056655', 'https://openalex.org/W1601133879', 'https://openalex.org/W3088067841', 'https://openalex.org/W4295513942', 'https://openalex.org/W2954996726', 'https://openalex.org/W4226323522', 'https://openalex.org/W3175301885', 'https://openalex.org/W3176923149']",2025-01-07

Towards Transparent, Trustworthy, Democratized Agents","Historically, researchers have focused on analyzing WEIRD, adult perspectives on technology. This means we may not have technology developed appropriately for children and those from non-WEIRD countries. In this paper, we analyze children and parents from various countries' perspectives on an emerging technology: conversational agents. We aim to better understand participants' trust of agents, partner models, and their ideas of ""ideal future agents"" such that researchers can better design for these users. Additionally, we empower children and parents to program their own agents through educational workshops, and present changes in perceptions as participants create and learn about agents. Results from the study (n=49) included how children felt agents were significantly more human-like, warm, and dependable than parents did, how participants trusted agents more than parents or friends for correct information, how children described their ideal agents as being more artificial than human-like than parents did, and how children tended to focus more on fun features, approachable/friendly features and addressing concerns through agent design than parents did, among other results. We also discuss potential agent design implications of the results, including how designers may be able to best foster appropriate levels of trust towards agents by focusing on designing agents' competence and predictability indicators, as well as increasing transparency in terms of agents' information sources.","['https://openalex.org/W2141766660', 'https://openalex.org/W3163442280', 'https://openalex.org/W2886572631', 'https://openalex.org/W6778883912', 'https://openalex.org/W2135363691', 'https://openalex.org/W4288359812', 'https://openalex.org/W3126382704', 'https://openalex.org/W4225082850', 'https://openalex.org/W3130937151', 'https://openalex.org/W3025165719', 'https://openalex.org/W2089358714', 'https://openalex.org/W2898089993', 'https://openalex.org/W2963026768', 'https://openalex.org/W3012624518', 'https://openalex.org/W2008021971', 'https://openalex.org/W3129009457', 'https://openalex.org/W1119960297', 'https://openalex.org/W2948116819', 'https://openalex.org/W1972753335', 'https://openalex.org/W2123534889', 'https://openalex.org/W2084235337', 'https://openalex.org/W2889495041', 'https://openalex.org/W2967206385', 'https://openalex.org/W3185000777', 'https://openalex.org/W1982451263', 'https://openalex.org/W2084944215', 'https://openalex.org/W2955826451', 'https://openalex.org/W3187653187', 'https://openalex.org/W2160779131', 'https://openalex.org/W6964593435', 'https://openalex.org/W3174968969', 'https://openalex.org/W3177181326', 'https://openalex.org/W4382318433', 'https://openalex.org/W2092969723', 'https://openalex.org/W3134428422', 'https://openalex.org/W3162051685', 'https://openalex.org/W4251560328', 'https://openalex.org/W3162165749', 'https://openalex.org/W1628789162', 'https://openalex.org/W4394671563', 'https://openalex.org/W3205692592']",2023-06-14

This article contributes to the critical literature on machine listening by presenting some of its history as a field. From the 1940s to the 1990s, work on artificial intelligence and audio developed along two streams. There was work on speech recognition/understanding, and work in computer music. In the early 1990s, another stream began to emerge. At institutions such as MIT Media Lab and Stanford's CCRMA, researchers started turning towards ""more fundamental problems of audition"". Propelled by work being done by and alongside musicians, speech and music would increasingly be understood by computer scientists as particular sounds within a broader ""auditory scene"". Researchers began to develop machine listening systems for a more diverse range of sounds and classification tasks: often in the service of speech recognition, but also increasingly for their own sake. The soundscape itself was becoming an object of computational concern. Today, the ambition is ""to cover all possible sounds"". That is the aspiration with which we must now contend politically, and which this article sets out to historicise and understand.","['https://openalex.org/W4413288418', 'https://openalex.org/W3045995288', 'https://openalex.org/W4235452281', 'https://openalex.org/W4238227321', 'https://openalex.org/W4236038202', 'https://openalex.org/W4240510634', 'https://openalex.org/W4256399001', 'https://openalex.org/W2068298977', 'https://openalex.org/W2026030136', 'https://openalex.org/W2044222806', 'https://openalex.org/W1977510622', 'https://openalex.org/W2082758173', 'https://openalex.org/W1991139021', 'https://openalex.org/W2889315866', 'https://openalex.org/W3005901320', 'https://openalex.org/W2020259652', 'https://openalex.org/W1001112348', 'https://openalex.org/W2097095326', 'https://openalex.org/W1965419851', 'https://openalex.org/W2159284348', 'https://openalex.org/W4253075065', 'https://openalex.org/W3116838706', 'https://openalex.org/W4399962391', 'https://openalex.org/W2603037960', 'https://openalex.org/W3210970177', 'https://openalex.org/W3185261023', 'https://openalex.org/W6749080293', 'https://openalex.org/W2555769234', 'https://openalex.org/W4236515469', 'https://openalex.org/W2593116425', 'https://openalex.org/W3103677873', 'https://openalex.org/W2153586312', 'https://openalex.org/W1486531642', 'https://openalex.org/W2048914355', 'https://openalex.org/W2103140519', 'https://openalex.org/W4243369708', 'https://openalex.org/W2122979854', 'https://openalex.org/W2505701133', 'https://openalex.org/W4313816055', 'https://openalex.org/W4311226163', 'https://openalex.org/W3129009457', 'https://openalex.org/W6814850485', 'https://openalex.org/W2144037622', 'https://openalex.org/W2070177582', 'https://openalex.org/W2789439097', 'https://openalex.org/W2788049062', 'https://openalex.org/W2141373701', 'https://openalex.org/W2913360400', 'https://openalex.org/W2046972719', 'https://openalex.org/W2612464443', 'https://openalex.org/W2331920492', 'https://openalex.org/W2493882299', 'https://openalex.org/W3023656861', 'https://openalex.org/W2736758126', 'https://openalex.org/W2066629230', 'https://openalex.org/W2566935005', 'https://openalex.org/W2151359505', 'https://openalex.org/W2063789736', 'https://openalex.org/W2643239522', 'https://openalex.org/W2123023349', 'https://openalex.org/W6678067405', 'https://openalex.org/W1977609277', 'https://openalex.org/W1992982563', 'https://openalex.org/W4250902796', 'https://openalex.org/W2943964375', 'https://openalex.org/W4249856834', 'https://openalex.org/W3212209585', 'https://openalex.org/W2002767771', 'https://openalex.org/W4235806191', 'https://openalex.org/W2075979668', 'https://openalex.org/W2062913357', 'https://openalex.org/W4238553276', 'https://openalex.org/W6712155849', 'https://openalex.org/W3140531618', 'https://openalex.org/W2318948281', 'https://openalex.org/W4255453945', 'https://openalex.org/W2955412730', 'https://openalex.org/W1599105370', 'https://openalex.org/W376085715', 'https://openalex.org/W6850607388', 'https://openalex.org/W3147911274', 'https://openalex.org/W4281676013', 'https://openalex.org/W2086384421', 'https://openalex.org/W1505221106', 'https://openalex.org/W2166894917', 'https://openalex.org/W6605752046', 'https://openalex.org/W2037761428', 'https://openalex.org/W122994913', 'https://openalex.org/W4233392025', 'https://openalex.org/W4247784448', 'https://openalex.org/W3213151880', 'https://openalex.org/W2074188409', 'https://openalex.org/W2486063739', 'https://openalex.org/W2492473494', 'https://openalex.org/W2796212141', 'https://openalex.org/W1661086764', 'https://openalex.org/W2944297474', 'https://openalex.org/W1500230234', 'https://openalex.org/W1994675634', 'https://openalex.org/W4233545208', 'https://openalex.org/W2504585274', 'https://openalex.org/W610324613', 'https://openalex.org/W1970185999', 'https://openalex.org/W4360988722', 'https://openalex.org/W2032498967', 'https://openalex.org/W1541647209', 'https://openalex.org/W2805618020', 'https://openalex.org/W2588217777', 'https://openalex.org/W1510737763', 'https://openalex.org/W1585961924', 'https://openalex.org/W2801777706', 'https://openalex.org/W2396542925', 'https://openalex.org/W4242644378', 'https://openalex.org/W2039407780']",2023-04-10

Most prior works can only work with electrodes on a 2D grid (i.e., Electrocorticographic or ECoG array) and data from a single patient. We aim to design a deep-learning model architecture that can accommodate both surface (ECoG) and depth (stereotactic EEG or sEEG) electrodes. The architecture should allow training on data from multiple participants with large variability in electrode placements and the trained model should perform well on participants unseen during training. Approach We propose a novel transformer-based model architecture named SwinTW that can work with arbitrarily positioned electrodes by leveraging their 3D locations on the cortex rather than their positions on a 2D grid. We train subject-specific models using data from a single participant and multi-patient models exploiting data from multiple participants. Main Results The subject-specific models using only low-density 8×8 ECoG data achieved high decoding Pearson Correlation Coefficient with ground truth spectrogram (PCC=0.817), over N=43 participants, outperforming our prior convolutional ResNet model and the 3D Swin transformer model. Incorporating additional strip, depth, and grid electrodes available in each participant (N=39) led to further improvement (PCC=0.838). For participants with only sEEG electrodes (N=9), subject-specific models still enjoy comparable performance with an average PCC=0.798. The multi-subject models achieved high performance on unseen participants, with an average PCC=0.765 in leave-one-out cross-validation. Significance The proposed SwinTW decoder enables future speech neuropros-theses to utilize any electrode placement that is clinically optimal or feasible for a particular participant, including using only depth electrodes, which are more routinely implanted in chronic neurosurgical procedures. Importantly, the generalizability of the multi-patient models suggests that such a model can be applied to new patients that do not have paired acoustic and neural data, providing an advance in neuroprostheses for people with speech disability, where acoustic-neural training data is not feasible.","['https://openalex.org/W2952609044', 'https://openalex.org/W4225307836', 'https://openalex.org/W3198923947', 'https://openalex.org/W2940585064', 'https://openalex.org/W2076676508', 'https://openalex.org/W2032275524', 'https://openalex.org/W4386815321', 'https://openalex.org/W2991804118', 'https://openalex.org/W4387378260', 'https://openalex.org/W2995233853', 'https://openalex.org/W3130062067', 'https://openalex.org/W2194775991', 'https://openalex.org/W2991284028', 'https://openalex.org/W3008011111', 'https://openalex.org/W3209059054', 'https://openalex.org/W2673183736', 'https://openalex.org/W3206311643', 'https://openalex.org/W4295350540', 'https://openalex.org/W1522301498', 'https://openalex.org/W3210188778', 'https://openalex.org/W4224926216', 'https://openalex.org/W2396366106', 'https://openalex.org/W3129009457', 'https://openalex.org/W4312349930', 'https://openalex.org/W3138516171', 'https://openalex.org/W4312560592', 'https://openalex.org/W4210261408', 'https://openalex.org/W3013691153', 'https://openalex.org/W4386100600', 'https://openalex.org/W2964982538', 'https://openalex.org/W3180220247', 'https://openalex.org/W2145817563', 'https://openalex.org/W2761532371', 'https://openalex.org/W2150823344', 'https://openalex.org/W2768153200', 'https://openalex.org/W4388842084', 'https://openalex.org/W4372342291', 'https://openalex.org/W3048859947', 'https://openalex.org/W3095432487', 'https://openalex.org/W2918972315', 'https://openalex.org/W2095516539', 'https://openalex.org/W4286462232', 'https://openalex.org/W3028375381', 'https://openalex.org/W4387526256', 'https://openalex.org/W4399722542', 'https://openalex.org/W4404955916']",2024-03-14

Previous work has shown that linear classifiers trained on CPC features can accurately predict speaker and phone labels. However, it is unclear how the features actually capture speaker and phonetic information, and whether it is possible to normalize out the irrelevant details (depending on the downstream task). In this paper, we first show that the per-utterance mean of CPC features captures speaker information to a large extent. Concretely, we find that comparing means performs well on a speaker verification task. Next, probing experiments show that standardizing the features effectively removes speaker information. Based on this observation, we propose a speaker normalization step to improve acoustic unit discovery using K-means clustering of CPC features. Finally, we show that a language model trained on the resulting units achieves some of the best results in the ZeroSpeech2021~Challenge.","['https://openalex.org/W3158802984', 'https://openalex.org/W3093096176', 'https://openalex.org/W2963620343', 'https://openalex.org/W3099782249', 'https://openalex.org/W3125709657', 'https://openalex.org/W3003875258', 'https://openalex.org/W2973026522', 'https://openalex.org/W2347098582', 'https://openalex.org/W2138615112', 'https://openalex.org/W2962689740', 'https://openalex.org/W2996728628', 'https://openalex.org/W2766049740', 'https://openalex.org/W3110458199', 'https://openalex.org/W2113054345', 'https://openalex.org/W2395899413', 'https://openalex.org/W2889326414', 'https://openalex.org/W2842511635', 'https://openalex.org/W2972943112', 'https://openalex.org/W3129009457', 'https://openalex.org/W2117041980', 'https://openalex.org/W1494198834', 'https://openalex.org/W2787447541', 'https://openalex.org/W3197381195', 'https://openalex.org/W2996383576', 'https://openalex.org/W3197349023', 'https://openalex.org/W2025482506', 'https://openalex.org/W2014307400', 'https://openalex.org/W3095361818', 'https://openalex.org/W2747874407', 'https://openalex.org/W2100768664']",2021-08-27

Without parameterizing a generative model, we apply Bayesian update formulas using a local linearity approximation parameterized by neural networks. This comes accompanied by a maximum likelihood objective that requires no supervision via uncorrupt observations or ground truth latent states. The optimization backpropagates through a recursion similar to the classical Kalman filter and smoother. Additionally, using an approximate conditional independence, we can perform smoothing without having to parameterize a separate model. In scientific applications, domain knowledge can give a linear approximation of the latent transition maps, which we can easily incorporate into our model. Usage of such domain knowledge is reflected in excellent results (despite our model's simplicity) on the chaotic Lorenz system compared to fully supervised and variational inference methods. Finally, we show competitive results on an audio denoising experiment.","['https://openalex.org/W2094227853', 'https://openalex.org/W3023201122', 'https://openalex.org/W1981364618', 'https://openalex.org/W2970375342', 'https://openalex.org/W2157331557', 'https://openalex.org/W2963074410', 'https://openalex.org/W2120615054', 'https://openalex.org/W2105934661', 'https://openalex.org/W2889928394', 'https://openalex.org/W2101675075', 'https://openalex.org/W2271522117', 'https://openalex.org/W2993076031', 'https://openalex.org/W2912752824', 'https://openalex.org/W2070047061', 'https://openalex.org/W2963166838', 'https://openalex.org/W2470207857', 'https://openalex.org/W2797583228', 'https://openalex.org/W3129009457', 'https://openalex.org/W2962986780', 'https://openalex.org/W2963714390', 'https://openalex.org/W2962695963', 'https://openalex.org/W2914204228', 'https://openalex.org/W2064675550', 'https://openalex.org/W2143612262', 'https://openalex.org/W2176035349', 'https://openalex.org/W2964232608', 'https://openalex.org/W2964204553', 'https://openalex.org/W2963403868', 'https://openalex.org/W2902857081', 'https://openalex.org/W2971082124', 'https://openalex.org/W2964334616', 'https://openalex.org/W3093010610', 'https://openalex.org/W2154368244']",2021-07-28

In any case, successful model training requires a non-trivial amount of memorization to store word spellings, various linguistic idiosyncrasies and common knowledge. However, little is known about what affects the memorization behavior of NLP models, as the field tends to focus on the equally important question of generalization. In this work, we demonstrate that the size of the subword vocabulary learned by Byte-Pair Encoding (BPE) greatly affects both ability and tendency of standard Transformer models to memorize training data, even when we control for the number of learned parameters. We find that with a large subword vocabulary size, Transformer models fit random mappings more easily and are more vulnerable to membership inference attacks. Similarly, given a prompt, Transformer-based language models with large subword vocabularies reproduce the training data more often. We conjecture this effect is caused by reduction in the sequences' length that happens as the BPE vocabulary grows. Our findings can allow a more informed choice of hyper-parameters, that is better tailored for a particular use-case.","['https://openalex.org/W2972433021', 'https://openalex.org/W3102659883', 'https://openalex.org/W2996094825', 'https://openalex.org/W2101105183', 'https://openalex.org/W2571532437', 'https://openalex.org/W3214210379', 'https://openalex.org/W2971869958', 'https://openalex.org/W3087835661', 'https://openalex.org/W2962784628', 'https://openalex.org/W3129009457', 'https://openalex.org/W3017374003', 'https://openalex.org/W3126425262', 'https://openalex.org/W3030163527', 'https://openalex.org/W2950220847', 'https://openalex.org/W3000779003', 'https://openalex.org/W2981852735', 'https://openalex.org/W2951528897', 'https://openalex.org/W2890077576', 'https://openalex.org/W2963430224', 'https://openalex.org/W3119000810', 'https://openalex.org/W3192500523', 'https://openalex.org/W3047026265', 'https://openalex.org/W2970971581', 'https://openalex.org/W2997731766', 'https://openalex.org/W2986378306', 'https://openalex.org/W3169369929', 'https://openalex.org/W2009525093', 'https://openalex.org/W3035168240', 'https://openalex.org/W2773466258', 'https://openalex.org/W3132730484', 'https://openalex.org/W2795435272', 'https://openalex.org/W2963250244', 'https://openalex.org/W2535690855', 'https://openalex.org/W3152698349', 'https://openalex.org/W2933138175', 'https://openalex.org/W2945767825', 'https://openalex.org/W2995154514', 'https://openalex.org/W3198320319', 'https://openalex.org/W3198217962', 'https://openalex.org/W1522301498', 'https://openalex.org/W2963005248', 'https://openalex.org/W2947029787', 'https://openalex.org/W2965373594', 'https://openalex.org/W3082928416', 'https://openalex.org/W1553508775', 'https://openalex.org/W1840435438', 'https://openalex.org/W2972324944', 'https://openalex.org/W2079656678', 'https://openalex.org/W2972498556', 'https://openalex.org/W3177804148', 'https://openalex.org/W3038040931', 'https://openalex.org/W2963267799', 'https://openalex.org/W3170672407', 'https://openalex.org/W1991762558', 'https://openalex.org/W2952744660', 'https://openalex.org/W2963341956', 'https://openalex.org/W3104739822', 'https://openalex.org/W3035207248', 'https://openalex.org/W2144862731', 'https://openalex.org/W3190860428', 'https://openalex.org/W2798663534', 'https://openalex.org/W2626778328']",2021-10-06

However, language modelling purely in the speech domain is still a relatively unexplored topic, with traditional speech LMs often depending on auxiliary text LMs for learning distributional aspects of the language. For the English language, these LMs treat words as atomic units, which presents inherent challenges to language modelling in the speech domain. In this paper, we propose a novel LSTM-based generative speech LM that is inspired by the CBOW model and built on linguistic units including syllables and phonemes. This offers better acoustic consistency across utterances in the dataset, as opposed to single melspectrogram frames, or whole words. With a limited dataset, orders of magnitude smaller than that required by contemporary generative models, our model closely approximates babbling speech. We show the effect of training with auxiliary text LMs, multitask learning objectives, and auxiliary articulatory features. Through our experiments, we also highlight some well known, but poorly documented challenges in training generative speech LMs, including the mismatch between the supervised learning objective with which these models are trained such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), and the true objective, which is speech quality. Our experiments provide an early indication that while validation loss and Mel Cepstral Distortion (MCD) are not strongly correlated with generated speech quality, traditional text language modelling metrics like perplexity and next-token-prediction accuracy might be.","['https://openalex.org/W2982223350', 'https://openalex.org/W2963609956', 'https://openalex.org/W2965373594', 'https://openalex.org/W3044438666', 'https://openalex.org/W2996286887', 'https://openalex.org/W179875071', 'https://openalex.org/W3199958362', 'https://openalex.org/W2963341956', 'https://openalex.org/W2973049979', 'https://openalex.org/W3030163527', 'https://openalex.org/W1579838312', 'https://openalex.org/W3095361947', 'https://openalex.org/W3129009457', 'https://openalex.org/W3001279689', 'https://openalex.org/W3134881075', 'https://openalex.org/W2572670101', 'https://openalex.org/W2963403868', 'https://openalex.org/W2962778134', 'https://openalex.org/W8140679', 'https://openalex.org/W1614298861', 'https://openalex.org/W2777448780']",2021-10-31

This is a field that lies at the intersection of Computer Vision (CV) and Natural Language Processing (NLP), and it involves various tasks, including creating textual descriptions of images and converting them directly into auditory representations. Another aspect of this field is the synthesis of natural speech from text. This has significant potential to improve accessibility, user experience, and the applications of Artificial Intelligence (AI). In this article, we reviewed a wide range of image-to-audio conversion techniques. Various aspects of image captioning, speech synthesis, and direct image-to-speech conversion have been explored, from fundamental encoder–decoder architectures to more advanced methods such as transformers and adversarial learning. Although the focus of this review is on synthesizing audio descriptions from visual data, the reverse task of creating visual content from natural language descriptions is also covered. This study provides a comprehensive overview of the techniques and methodologies used in these fields and highlights the strengths and weaknesses of each approach. The study emphasizes the importance of various datasets, such as MS COCO, LibriTTS, and VizWiz Captions, which play a critical role in training models, evaluating them, promoting inclusivity, and solving real-world problems. The implications for the future suggest the potential of generating more natural and contextualized audio descriptions, whereas direct image-to-speech tasks provide opportunities for intuitive auditory representations of visual content.","['https://openalex.org/W4299541593', 'https://openalex.org/W2112955368', 'https://openalex.org/W2885959306', 'https://openalex.org/W6765342010', 'https://openalex.org/W3198196812', 'https://openalex.org/W4230559685', 'https://openalex.org/W2996011278', 'https://openalex.org/W2169153920', 'https://openalex.org/W2001538905', 'https://openalex.org/W4292455922', 'https://openalex.org/W2463955103', 'https://openalex.org/W3160100917', 'https://openalex.org/W3165571294', 'https://openalex.org/W3122720459', 'https://openalex.org/W1514535095', 'https://openalex.org/W6739901393', 'https://openalex.org/W6770800577', 'https://openalex.org/W2607151106', 'https://openalex.org/W2963084599', 'https://openalex.org/W2902440562', 'https://openalex.org/W2962968835', 'https://openalex.org/W2604178507', 'https://openalex.org/W3018385214', 'https://openalex.org/W2901988662', 'https://openalex.org/W6640200569', 'https://openalex.org/W1570629387', 'https://openalex.org/W2056191164', 'https://openalex.org/W2150658333', 'https://openalex.org/W133559434', 'https://openalex.org/W1600722501', 'https://openalex.org/W2154920538', 'https://openalex.org/W200094172', 'https://openalex.org/W2145575463', 'https://openalex.org/W175280642', 'https://openalex.org/W344150399', 'https://openalex.org/W3142087749', 'https://openalex.org/W2129142580', 'https://openalex.org/W2102003408', 'https://openalex.org/W2134973740', 'https://openalex.org/W2294797155', 'https://openalex.org/W2806733747', 'https://openalex.org/W1576227399', 'https://openalex.org/W2515943672', 'https://openalex.org/W2963609956', 'https://openalex.org/W3197407562', 'https://openalex.org/W3095990227', 'https://openalex.org/W6748588790', 'https://openalex.org/W3174311593', 'https://openalex.org/W2997208288', 'https://openalex.org/W2969302028', 'https://openalex.org/W2113899393', 'https://openalex.org/W4206865574', 'https://openalex.org/W3155217823', 'https://openalex.org/W3206387123', 'https://openalex.org/W3095909497', 'https://openalex.org/W4389959945', 'https://openalex.org/W3007780968', 'https://openalex.org/W3203245760', 'https://openalex.org/W3199400376', 'https://openalex.org/W4289600032', 'https://openalex.org/W6676497082', 'https://openalex.org/W68733909', 'https://openalex.org/W2185175083', 'https://openalex.org/W1861492603', 'https://openalex.org/W1895989618', 'https://openalex.org/W2963062932', 'https://openalex.org/W2886641317', 'https://openalex.org/W3110019360', 'https://openalex.org/W3095670406', 'https://openalex.org/W3106859150', 'https://openalex.org/W6917585676', 'https://openalex.org/W1494198834', 'https://openalex.org/W2972359262', 'https://openalex.org/W3197824033', 'https://openalex.org/W4297570641', 'https://openalex.org/W3198533616', 'https://openalex.org/W3204379680', 'https://openalex.org/W3155727213', 'https://openalex.org/W2963902314', 'https://openalex.org/W3197064454', 'https://openalex.org/W2962862718', 'https://openalex.org/W4385245566', 'https://openalex.org/W3008618223', 'https://openalex.org/W4320013936', 'https://openalex.org/W2788357188', 'https://openalex.org/W2109586012']",2024-04-30

There are two main approaches to perform the evaluation; subjective and objective. Subjective approaches use human as the assessor, which is the most natural approach. However, it is time-consuming and expensive. Hence, it has generally been replaced by the quicker and cheaper objective approaches. Nevertheless, since objective approaches only analyze the audio features, the predicted quality might not correlated to what humans would perceive. Recent studies shows that brain activity contains some information that can be useful to enhance the prediction performance.

https://openalex.org/W3136576491,https://doi.org/10.48550/arxiv.2103.08199,Double Articulation Analyzer with Prosody for Unsupervised Word and Phoneme Discovery,"Infants acquire words and phonemes from unsegmented speech signals using segmentation cues, such as distributional, prosodic, and co-occurrence cues. Many pre-existing computational models that represent the process tend to focus on distributional or prosodic cues. This paper proposes a nonparametric Bayesian probabilistic generative model called the prosodic hierarchical Dirichlet process-hidden language model (Prosodic HDP-HLM). Prosodic HDP-HLM, an extension of HDP-HLM, considers both prosodic and distributional cues within a single integrative generative model. We conducted three experiments on different types of datasets, and demonstrate the validity of the proposed method. The results show that the Prosodic DAA successfully uses prosodic cues and outperforms a method that solely uses distributional cues. The main contributions of this study are as follows: 1) We develop a probabilistic generative model for time series data including prosody that potentially has a double articulation structure; 2) We propose the Prosodic DAA by deriving the inference procedure for Prosodic HDP-HLM and show that Prosodic DAA can discover words directly from continuous human speech signals using statistical information and prosodic information in an unsupervised manner; 3) We show that prosodic cues contribute to word segmentation more in naturally distributed case words, i.e., they follow Zipf's law.","['https://openalex.org/W2256409625', 'https://openalex.org/W2607257024', 'https://openalex.org/W2099626219', 'https://openalex.org/W2153767712', 'https://openalex.org/W1502984613', 'https://openalex.org/W3027324582', 'https://openalex.org/W1980862600', 'https://openalex.org/W2073685522', 'https://openalex.org/W2017449852', 'https://openalex.org/W1796128977', 'https://openalex.org/W2908005395', 'https://openalex.org/W1778492285', 'https://openalex.org/W2767009175', 'https://openalex.org/W2165470078', 'https://openalex.org/W2157149948', 'https://openalex.org/W2100768664', 'https://openalex.org/W2220867547', 'https://openalex.org/W2121137195', 'https://openalex.org/W3004441278', 'https://openalex.org/W2963720603', 'https://openalex.org/W2022058071', 'https://openalex.org/W2752552296', 'https://openalex.org/W2772857214', 'https://openalex.org/W2055226328', 'https://openalex.org/W2066006005', 'https://openalex.org/W2900800742', 'https://openalex.org/W2951004968', 'https://openalex.org/W2962206103', 'https://openalex.org/W3102667484', 'https://openalex.org/W2115867364', 'https://openalex.org/W2468716020', 'https://openalex.org/W2335112305', 'https://openalex.org/W2170353620', 'https://openalex.org/W2124973255', 'https://openalex.org/W2041258965', 'https://openalex.org/W2795648103', 'https://openalex.org/W2024079589', 'https://openalex.org/W1993755070', 'https://openalex.org/W2110614779', 'https://openalex.org/W2142111485', 'https://openalex.org/W2078769636', 'https://openalex.org/W2912021853', 'https://openalex.org/W2059824090', 'https://openalex.org/W2465308763', 'https://openalex.org/W2296607128', 'https://openalex.org/W2294206829']",2021-03-15
https://openalex.org/W3217035088,https://doi.org/10.1109/lsp.2022.3161115,Non-Intrusive Binaural Speech Intelligibility Prediction From Discrete Latent Representations,"Non-intrusive speech intelligibility (SI) prediction from binaural signals is useful in many applications. However, most existing signal-based measures are designed to be applied to single-channel signals. Measures specifically designed to take into account the binaural properties of the signal are often intrusive - characterised by requiring access to a clean speech signal - and typically rely on combining both channels into a single-channel signal before making predictions. This paper proposes a non-intrusive SI measure that computes features from a binaural input signal using a combination of vector quantization (VQ) and contrastive predictive coding (CPC) methods. VQ-CPC feature extraction does not rely on any model of the auditory system and is instead trained to maximise the mutual information between the input signal and output features. The computed VQ-CPC features are input to a predicting function parameterized by a neural network. Two predicting functions are considered in this paper. Both feature extractor and predicting functions are trained on simulated binaural signals with isotropic noise. They are tested on simulated signals with isotropic and real noise. For all signals, the ground truth scores are the (intrusive) deterministic binaural STOI. Results are presented in terms of correlations and MSE and demonstrate that VQ-CPC features are able to capture information relevant to modelling SI and outperform all the considered benchmarks - even when evaluating on data comprising of different noise field types.","['https://openalex.org/W2605449545', 'https://openalex.org/W6789284391', 'https://openalex.org/W1985029311', 'https://openalex.org/W1987831012', 'https://openalex.org/W2141998673', 'https://openalex.org/W2034593061', 'https://openalex.org/W2602577565', 'https://openalex.org/W2809058357', 'https://openalex.org/W2765278963', 'https://openalex.org/W3086428351', 'https://openalex.org/W6785906987', 'https://openalex.org/W2147101913', 'https://openalex.org/W1986177448', 'https://openalex.org/W1996646214', 'https://openalex.org/W2465704452', 'https://openalex.org/W3163472112', 'https://openalex.org/W3111796160', 'https://openalex.org/W2048741136', 'https://openalex.org/W2342810974', 'https://openalex.org/W2809874909', 'https://openalex.org/W6844194202', 'https://openalex.org/W3095361818', 'https://openalex.org/W2973049979', 'https://openalex.org/W6769196770', 'https://openalex.org/W2752796333', 'https://openalex.org/W6795062860', 'https://openalex.org/W1494198834', 'https://openalex.org/W2136682440', 'https://openalex.org/W6688816777', 'https://openalex.org/W2089586791', 'https://openalex.org/W3197832224', 'https://openalex.org/W4213196139', 'https://openalex.org/W2009649672', 'https://openalex.org/W6674330103', 'https://openalex.org/W6638667902', 'https://openalex.org/W6640212811', 'https://openalex.org/W6766978945', 'https://openalex.org/W2219249508', 'https://openalex.org/W2939710050', 'https://openalex.org/W2095705004', 'https://openalex.org/W2970971581', 'https://openalex.org/W3027324582', 'https://openalex.org/W2949117887', 'https://openalex.org/W3124666641', 'https://openalex.org/W2996383576', 'https://openalex.org/W1924770834', 'https://openalex.org/W2842511635', 'https://openalex.org/W3105857760', 'https://openalex.org/W2963799213', 'https://openalex.org/W3159778524']",2022-01-01

Furthermore, a computational model that enables an artificial cognitive system to achieve cognitive development will be an excellent reference for brain and cognitive science. This paper describes the development of a cognitive architecture using probabilistic generative models (PGMs) to fully mirror the human cognitive system. The integrative model is called a whole-brain PGM (WB-PGM). It is both brain-inspired and PGMbased.

Although we have released an open-source VC software based on the Gaussian mixture model named sprocket in the last VC Challenge, it is not straightforward to apply any speech corpus because it is necessary to prepare parallel utterances of source and target speakers to model a statistical conversion function. To address this issue, in this study, we developed a new open-source VC software that enables users to model the conversion function by using only a nonparallel speech corpus. For implementing the VC software, we used a vector-quantized variational autoencoder (VQVAE). To rapidly examine the effectiveness of recent technologies developed in this research field, crank also supports several representative works for autoencoder-based VC methods such as the use of hierarchical architectures, cyclic architectures, generative adversarial networks, speaker adversarial training, and neural vocoders. Moreover, it is possible to automatically estimate objective measures such as mel-cepstrum distortion and pseudo mean opinion score based on MOSNet. In this paper, we describe representative functions developed in crank and make brief comparisons by objective evaluations.","['https://openalex.org/W3082130377', 'https://openalex.org/W2949382160', 'https://openalex.org/W2962896155', 'https://openalex.org/W3015338123', 'https://openalex.org/W3092246895', 'https://openalex.org/W2946555236', 'https://openalex.org/W2518172956', 'https://openalex.org/W3027324582', 'https://openalex.org/W3199367817', 'https://openalex.org/W2963035245', 'https://openalex.org/W2510867321', 'https://openalex.org/W2937579788', 'https://openalex.org/W2052871313', 'https://openalex.org/W2994715919', 'https://openalex.org/W2963539064', 'https://openalex.org/W2972544500', 'https://openalex.org/W3101689408', 'https://openalex.org/W2937993361', 'https://openalex.org/W2242818861', 'https://openalex.org/W2972849140', 'https://openalex.org/W2532494225', 'https://openalex.org/W2964069186', 'https://openalex.org/W2963799213', 'https://openalex.org/W2156142001', 'https://openalex.org/W2598638573', 'https://openalex.org/W2120847449', 'https://openalex.org/W2971074500', 'https://openalex.org/W3100378519', 'https://openalex.org/W2548275288', 'https://openalex.org/W2012086895', 'https://openalex.org/W3093058615', 'https://openalex.org/W1524333225', 'https://openalex.org/W2800289214', 'https://openalex.org/W1509691205']",2021-03-04

Our experiments show that with the existing algorithms there is a trade off between categorization and segmentation performance. We investigate the source of this conflict and conclude that the use of context building networks, albeit necessary for superior performance on categorization tasks, harms segmentation performance by causing a temporal shift on the learned representations. Aiming to bridge this gap, we take inspiration from the leading approach on segmentation, which simultaneously models the speech signal at the frame and phoneme level, and incorporate multi-level modelling into Aligned CPC (ACPC), a variation of CPC which exhibits the best performance on categorization tasks. Our multi-level ACPC (mACPC) improves in all categorization metrics and achieves state-of-the-art performance in word segmentation.","['https://openalex.org/W130754613', 'https://openalex.org/W2064675550', 'https://openalex.org/W6739901393', 'https://openalex.org/W6674330103', 'https://openalex.org/W6786696081', 'https://openalex.org/W2842511635', 'https://openalex.org/W6787178341', 'https://openalex.org/W2127141656', 'https://openalex.org/W3197974236', 'https://openalex.org/W6917638038', 'https://openalex.org/W1494198834', 'https://openalex.org/W3198782837', 'https://openalex.org/W3096656254', 'https://openalex.org/W2145410271', 'https://openalex.org/W4297808394', 'https://openalex.org/W3127686677', 'https://openalex.org/W3198134274', 'https://openalex.org/W3110458199', 'https://openalex.org/W4287591426', 'https://openalex.org/W2963403868', 'https://openalex.org/W3112613336', 'https://openalex.org/W4385245566', 'https://openalex.org/W2095705004']",2022-04-27

Likewise, the singing voice also has timbral phenomena. In vocal pedagogy, vocal teachers listen and then describe the timbral phenomena of their student’s singing voice. In this study, in order to enable machines to describe the singing voice from the vocal pedagogy point of view, we perform a task called paralinguistic singing attribute recognition. To achieve this goal, we first construct and publish an open source dataset named Singing Voice Quality and Technique Database (SVQTD) for supervised learning. All the audio clips in SVQTD are downloaded from YouTube and processed by music source separation and silence detection. For annotation, seven paralinguistic singing attributes commonly used in vocal pedagogy are adopted as the labels. Furthermore, to explore the different supervised machine learning algorithm for classifying each paralinguistic singing attribute, we adopt three main frameworks, namely openSMILE features with support vector machine (SF-SVM), end-to-end deep learning (E2EDL), and deep embedding with support vector machine (DE-SVM). Our methods are based on existing frameworks commonly employed in other paralinguistic speech attribute recognition tasks. In SF-SVM, we separately use the feature set of the INTERSPEECH 2009 Challenge and that of the INTERSPEECH 2016 Challenge as the SVM classifier’s input. In E2EDL, the end-to-end framework separately utilizes the ResNet and transformer encoder as feature extractors. In particular, to handle two-dimensional spectrogram input for a transformer, we adopt a sliced multi-head self-attention (SMSA) mechanism. In the DE-SVM, we use the representation extracted from the E2EDL model as the input of the SVM classifier. Experimental results on SVQTD show no absolute winner between E2EDL and the DE-SVM, which means that the back-end SVM classifier with the representation learned by E2E as input does not necessarily improve the performance. However, the DE-SVM that utilizes the ResNet as the feature extractor achieves the best average UAR, with an average 16% improvement over that of the SF-SVM with INTERSPEECH’s hand-crafted feature set.","['https://openalex.org/W1971525508', 'https://openalex.org/W2169295472', 'https://openalex.org/W2189397211', 'https://openalex.org/W2111926505', 'https://openalex.org/W2020866611', 'https://openalex.org/W2094085880', 'https://openalex.org/W2115002300', 'https://openalex.org/W2051580501', 'https://openalex.org/W2054287732', 'https://openalex.org/W2028895660', 'https://openalex.org/W3213967396', 'https://openalex.org/W2321391359', 'https://openalex.org/W1943497805', 'https://openalex.org/W2059970763', 'https://openalex.org/W6930575966', 'https://openalex.org/W2058392145', 'https://openalex.org/W2085662862', 'https://openalex.org/W2513507089', 'https://openalex.org/W2119417805', 'https://openalex.org/W2034345148', 'https://openalex.org/W786031425', 'https://openalex.org/W2002299114', 'https://openalex.org/W2089364955', 'https://openalex.org/W2137371678', 'https://openalex.org/W2120256304', 'https://openalex.org/W2170938075', 'https://openalex.org/W1995663108', 'https://openalex.org/W2399733683', 'https://openalex.org/W3095513995', 'https://openalex.org/W2746419079', 'https://openalex.org/W2973025177', 'https://openalex.org/W2889467522', 'https://openalex.org/W2972411915', 'https://openalex.org/W3037149862', 'https://openalex.org/W3000819039', 'https://openalex.org/W3033704032', 'https://openalex.org/W2009955221', 'https://openalex.org/W2000860788', 'https://openalex.org/W2037239148', 'https://openalex.org/W2174219101', 'https://openalex.org/W1998038926', 'https://openalex.org/W2067002903', 'https://openalex.org/W2033012815', 'https://openalex.org/W1570824959', 'https://openalex.org/W109946471', 'https://openalex.org/W2128980425', 'https://openalex.org/W2074788634', 'https://openalex.org/W1501669607', 'https://openalex.org/W2082927806', 'https://openalex.org/W6828894009', 'https://openalex.org/W2194775991', 'https://openalex.org/W2405274704', 'https://openalex.org/W2963351448', 'https://openalex.org/W576379397', 'https://openalex.org/W4299308749', 'https://openalex.org/W2612690371', 'https://openalex.org/W4212774754', 'https://openalex.org/W2535255545', 'https://openalex.org/W2742451886', 'https://openalex.org/W1521262965', 'https://openalex.org/W3136889378']",2022-04-15

Artificial Intelligence and the Symphony Orchestra,"This chapter documents a process of practice-based research concerning the relationship between artificial intelligence and classical music. I argue that classical music (as an industry) is well placed o answer salient questions that the age of artificial intelligence demands we consider. The relationship is explored through three themes, which are: 1. The relationship between the future and the past 2. The idea of “authenticity” 3. The notion of music as an abstract artform that can or cannot be reduced to data alone Using these thematic areas as a bedrock, the case study will discuss the three- movement work Silicon, written for the BBC Philharmonic Orchestra. Drawing from my own practice and views the case study will explore how this new technology affects, and will affect, the way an orchestra interacts with a composer, and how orchestral music can be used to explore technology that has an increasingly profound effect on all aspects of our day-to-day lives. Alongside theoretical and aesthetic ties between classical music and artificial intelligence, practical methodologies for utilising artificial intelligence as part of the creative process will be explored. This includes the benefits and limitations of using artificial intelligence to create or develop musical material, long-term structures, or novel synthesized instruments, and also some compositional methodologies I have developed to magnify or mitigate the effect of artificial intelligence on a large-scale work.","['https://openalex.org/W2325249702', 'https://openalex.org/W2789439097', 'https://openalex.org/W3158826226', 'https://openalex.org/W4248428759', 'https://openalex.org/W6770076868', 'https://openalex.org/W3207559276', 'https://openalex.org/W3003668765', 'https://openalex.org/W4220820301', 'https://openalex.org/W3000389243', 'https://openalex.org/W6688413453', 'https://openalex.org/W2560316200', 'https://openalex.org/W2952428868', 'https://openalex.org/W2800068420', 'https://openalex.org/W2794157322', 'https://openalex.org/W3206525235', 'https://openalex.org/W3093199223', 'https://openalex.org/W6749133656', 'https://openalex.org/W2988750365', 'https://openalex.org/W2004353254', 'https://openalex.org/W2792048062', 'https://openalex.org/W2799040008', 'https://openalex.org/W3213967396', 'https://openalex.org/W3037480493', 'https://openalex.org/W597620852', 'https://openalex.org/W2210543184', 'https://openalex.org/W2963575853', 'https://openalex.org/W2930789748']",2024-01-30

For the perishable skill of English language learning, use of innovative speech recognition technology using Advanced Speech Recognition Technologies MLP-LSTM is proposed in this paper to advance the existing online learning platforms. Previous research addresses the importance of NLP in English language learning but notes the challenges in effectively extracting and segmenting features from multimodal data. In order to overcome these problems, this paper incorporate the proposed MLP for feature extraction and LSTM for sequence learning. The utilization of MLP-LSTM provides not only a brilliant improvement of the capacity to transform spoken language and perceive it but also minimizes the Word Error Rate (WER) to 0.075. With this low WER, along with the total accuracy rate of 98.25 %, this paper focus on underlining how this system is more effective than traditional language learning tools. This paper has been implemented through Python Software. The given MLP-LSTM based speech recognition model lays the foundation for a highly complex yet accurate paced English language learning platform that will cater to the needs of the learners in the global scenario.","['https://openalex.org/W4307286264', 'https://openalex.org/W3132830522', 'https://openalex.org/W6795952400', 'https://openalex.org/W6793802969', 'https://openalex.org/W4385260920', 'https://openalex.org/W3010748916', 'https://openalex.org/W3002741552', 'https://openalex.org/W2981858587', 'https://openalex.org/W6782880199', 'https://openalex.org/W4221161761', 'https://openalex.org/W6785154326', 'https://openalex.org/W3037057938', 'https://openalex.org/W3207558756', 'https://openalex.org/W4311000453', 'https://openalex.org/W4225274946', 'https://openalex.org/W2998386507', 'https://openalex.org/W3011516543', 'https://openalex.org/W3017022801', 'https://openalex.org/W3118883493', 'https://openalex.org/W2971766686', 'https://openalex.org/W3176616792', 'https://openalex.org/W3006156918', 'https://openalex.org/W4319302797', 'https://openalex.org/W3081285175', 'https://openalex.org/W2964732384', 'https://openalex.org/W6646543388', 'https://openalex.org/W4385692946', 'https://openalex.org/W3156503941', 'https://openalex.org/W3122499880']",2024-10-19

Although this technology represents one of the central objectives of AI and has been the focus of ever more intense research and development efforts, it is currently limited to a few narrow domains (e.g., food ordering, ticket booking) and a handful of languages (e.g., English, Chinese). This work provides an extensive overview of existing methods and resources in multilingual ToD as an entry point to this exciting and emerging field. We find that the most critical factor preventing the creation of truly multilingual ToD systems is the lack of datasets in most languages for both training and evaluation. In fact, acquiring annotations or human feedback for each component of modular systems or for data-hungry end-to-end systems is expensive and tedious. Hence, state-of-the-art approaches to multilingual ToD mostly rely on (zero- or few-shot) cross-lingual transfer from resource-rich languages (almost exclusively English), either by means of (i) machine translation or (ii) multilingual representations. These approaches are currently viable only for typologically similar languages and languages with parallel / monolingual corpora available. On the other hand, their effectiveness beyond these boundaries is doubtful or hard to assess due to the lack of linguistically diverse benchmarks (especially for natural language generation and end-to-end evaluation). To overcome this limitation, we draw parallels between components of the ToD pipeline and other NLP tasks, which can inspire solutions for learning in low-resource scenarios. Finally, we list additional challenges that multilinguality poses for related areas (such as speech, fluency in generated text, and human-centred evaluation), and indicate future directions that hold promise to further expand language coverage and dialogue capabilities of current ToD systems.","['https://openalex.org/W6777875527', 'https://openalex.org/W6758715935',

Many studies leverage knowledge distillation to boost predictive performance by transferring the knowledge from large models to on-device models. However, most lack a mechanism to distill the essence of the temporal information, which is crucial to audio classification tasks, or similar architecture is often required. In this paper, we propose a new knowledge distillation method designed to incorporate the temporal knowledge embedded in attention weights of large transformer-based models into on-device models. Our distillation method is applicable to various types of architectures, including the non-attention-based architectures such as CNNs or RNNs, while retaining the original network architecture during inference. Through extensive experiments on both an audio event detection dataset and a noisy keyword spotting dataset, we show that our proposed method improves the predictive performance across diverse on-device architectures.","['https://openalex.org/W6739901393', 'https://openalex.org/W6730179637', 'https://openalex.org/W3095385545', 'https://openalex.org/W6779919476', 'https://openalex.org/W2593116425', 'https://openalex.org/W6755207826', 'https://openalex.org/W6761660874', 'https://openalex.org/W2953219395', 'https://openalex.org/W2888641632', 'https://openalex.org/W3096297644', 'https://openalex.org/W6783462664', 'https://openalex.org/W6638523607', 'https://openalex.org/W2963864497', 'https://openalex.org/W2963681135', 'https://openalex.org/W3198035615', 'https://openalex.org/W3025581723', 'https://openalex.org/W6750665317', 'https://openalex.org/W3198715852', 'https://openalex.org/W2470673105', 'https://openalex.org/W2936774411', 'https://openalex.org/W3035422918', 'https://openalex.org/W4205689591', 'https://openalex.org/W2973226577', 'https://openalex.org/W2963341956', 'https://openalex.org/W2561238782', 'https://openalex.org/W1821462560', 'https://openalex.org/W3198429080', 'https://openalex.org/W2896457183', 'https://openalex.org/W3090388844', 'https://openalex.org/W4385245566', 'https://openalex.org/W3037057938', 'https://openalex.org/W3170968215', 'https://openalex.org/W2930364467', 'https://openalex.org/W2963403868', 'https://openalex.org/W4285719527', 'https://openalex.org/W2797583228', 'https://openalex.org/W2602634800']",2022-04-27

To overcome the long-tail problem, in this paper, we propose Adapt-and-Adjust (A2), a transformer-based multi-task learning framework for end-to-end multilingual speech recognition. The A2 framework overcomes the long-tail problem via three techniques: (1) exploiting a pretrained multilingual language model (mBERT) to improve the performance of low-resource languages; (2) proposing dual adapters consisting of both language-specific and language-agnostic adaptation with minimal additional parameters; and (3) overcoming the class imbalance, either by imposing class priors in the loss during training or adjusting the logits of the softmax output during inference. Extensive experiments on the CommonVoice corpus show that A2 significantly outperforms conventional approaches.","['https://openalex.org/W2461918431', 'https://openalex.org/W2397987315', 'https://openalex.org/W3042667808', 'https://openalex.org/W3096032230', 'https://openalex.org/W2971840980', 'https://openalex.org/W2148143831', 'https://openalex.org/W2962893195', 'https://openalex.org/W2963691377', 'https://openalex.org/W2892009249', 'https://openalex.org/W2970206392', 'https://openalex.org/W2995197345', 'https://openalex.org/W2127141656', 'https://openalex.org/W2964303773', 'https://openalex.org/W2963403868', 'https://openalex.org/W3037057938', 'https://openalex.org/W2795935804', 'https://openalex.org/W2104539041', 'https://openalex.org/W2972389417', 'https://openalex.org/W2964309797', 'https://openalex.org/W2952470929', 'https://openalex.org/W2978017171', 'https://openalex.org/W3023911605', 'https://openalex.org/W3030437843', 'https://openalex.org/W1986174057', 'https://openalex.org/W3015697211', 'https://openalex.org/W2143612262', 'https://openalex.org/W2963211188', 'https://openalex.org/W2131427446', 'https://openalex.org/W1855892484', 'https://openalex.org/W3042496707', 'https://openalex.org/W3035552357', 'https://openalex.org/W2950304420', 'https://openalex.org/W2119191234', 'https://openalex.org/W1965555277', 'https://openalex.org/W2963341956', 'https://openalex.org/W2963979492', 'https://openalex.org/W3035390927', 'https://openalex.org/W2970941190', 'https://openalex.org/W2148226542', 'https://openalex.org/W85350352']",2021-08-27

METHODS Eligible participants completed demographic, cognitive, functional assessments and the DCS. Neuropsychological tests were used to assess domain‐specific and global cognition, while the diagnosis of MCI and dementia relied on the Clinical Dementia Rating Scale. RESULTS Among the 11,186 participants, the DCS showed high completion rates (97.5%) and a short administration time (5.9 min) across gender, age, and education groups. The DCS demonstrated areas under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUCs) of 0.95 and 0.83 for dementia and MCI detection, respectively, among 328 participants in the validation phase. Furthermore, the DCS resulted in time savings of 16.2% to 36.0% compared to the Mini‐Mental State Examination (MMSE) and Montral Cognitive Assessment (MoCA). DISCUSSION This study suggests that the DCS is an effective and efficient tool for dementia and MCI case‐finding in large‐scale cognitive screening. Highlights To our best knowledge, this is the first cognitive screening tool based on voice recognition and utilizing conversational AI that has been assessed in a large population of Chinese community‐dwelling elderly. With the upgrading of a new multimodal understanding model, the DCS can accurately assess participants' responses, including different Chinese dialects, and provide automatic scores. The DCS not only exhibited good discriminant ability in detecting dementia and MCI cases, it also demonstrated a high completion rate and efficient administration regardless of gender, age, and education differences. The DCS is economically efficient, scalable, and had a better screening efficacy compared to the MMSE or MoCA, for wider implementation.","['https://openalex.org/W2754967293', 'https://openalex.org/W2971598158', 'https://openalex.org/W4313812373', 'https://openalex.org/W4210462706', 'https://openalex.org/W3008391208', 'https://openalex.org/W3106725626', 'https://openalex.org/W4308426417', 'https://openalex.org/W3046275966', 'https://openalex.org/W4212957127', 'https://openalex.org/W3014561849', 'https://openalex.org/W2907272110', 'https://openalex.org/W3209426885', 'https://openalex.org/W3184269374', 'https://openalex.org/W4286697593', 'https://openalex.org/W4284667718', 'https://openalex.org/W2150246838', 'https://openalex.org/W2041981133', 'https://openalex.org/W4308766716', 'https://openalex.org/W4287890956', 'https://openalex.org/W4282048378', 'https://openalex.org/W3037057938', 'https://openalex.org/W2995590269', 'https://openalex.org/W2113082716', 'https://openalex.org/W2102150307', 'https://openalex.org/W3041185083', 'https://openalex.org/W3193821230', 'https://openalex.org/W2271953872', 'https://openalex.org/W2165758561', 'https://openalex.org/W1847168837', 'https://openalex.org/W2136250824', 'https://openalex.org/W2903296995', 'https://openalex.org/W2896841832', 'https://openalex.org/W4220730951', 'https://openalex.org/W2772976454', 'https://openalex.org/W2971452237', 'https://openalex.org/W2161769056', 'https://openalex.org/W3127826753', 'https://openalex.org/W3204082461', 'https://openalex.org/W2699929765', 'https://openalex.org/W2913295464', 'https://openalex.org/W2955844975', 'https://openalex.org/W2008854521', 'https://openalex.org/W4385574358', 'https://openalex.org/W4391436317', 'https://openalex.org/W3198429080', 'https://openalex.org/W2167311298', 'https://openalex.org/W2990959992', 'https://openalex.org/W2148080316', 'https://openalex.org/W2058161128']",2024-02-01

For on-device speech recognition tasks, researchers and industry prefer end-to-end ASR systems as they can be made resource-efficient while maintaining a higher quality compared to hybrid systems. However, building end-to-end models requires a significant amount of speech data. Personalization, which is mainly handling out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words, is another challenging task associated with speech assistants. In this work, we consider building an effective end-to-end ASR system in low-resource setups with a high OOV rate, embodied in Babel Turkish and Babel Georgian tasks. We propose a method of dynamic acoustic unit augmentation based on the Byte Pair Encoding with dropout (BPE-dropout) technique. The method non-deterministically tokenizes utterances to extend the token’s contexts and to regularize their distribution for the model’s recognition of unseen words. It also reduces the need for optimal subword vocabulary size search. The technique provides a steady improvement in regular and personalized (OOV-oriented) speech recognition tasks (at least 6% relative word error rate (WER) and 25% relative F-score) at no additional computational cost. Owing to the BPE-dropout use, our monolingual Turkish Conformer has achieved a competitive result with 22.2% character error rate (CER) and 38.9% WER, which is close to the best published multilingual system.","['https://openalex.org/W2996769030', 'https://openalex.org/W3015194534', 'https://openalex.org/W3096686110', 'https://openalex.org/W2889511491', 'https://openalex.org/W2160815625', 'https://openalex.org/W2127141656', 'https://openalex.org/W2327501763', 'https://openalex.org/W1604697534', 'https://openalex.org/W3088860656', 'https://openalex.org/W2737429942', 'https://openalex.org/W2903732155', 'https://openalex.org/W2714176837', 'https://openalex.org/W3097794466', 'https://openalex.org/W2962784628', 'https://openalex.org/W2963979492', 'https://openalex.org/W2117621558', 'https://openalex.org/W3009065282', 'https://openalex.org/W3035207248', 'https://openalex.org/W2938348542', 'https://openalex.org/W3095229326', 'https://openalex.org/W3100684858', 'https://openalex.org/W3120549770', 'https://openalex.org/W3118510458', 'https://openalex.org/W3034789084', 'https://openalex.org/W3126537755', 'https://openalex.org/W3015537910', 'https://openalex.org/W1828163288', 'https://openalex.org/W3094667432', 'https://openalex.org/W3018441253', 'https://openalex.org/W2526425061', 'https://openalex.org/W6739901393', 'https://openalex.org/W3035531585', 'https://openalex.org/W3024464021', 'https://openalex.org/W3097777922', 'https://openalex.org/W3163793923', 'https://openalex.org/W3038736627', 'https://openalex.org/W6631190155', 'https://openalex.org/W6743178762', 'https://openalex.org/W2936774411', 'https://openalex.org/W2963250244', 'https://openalex.org/W2962780374', 'https://openalex.org/W3196321886', 'https://openalex.org/W2407080277', 'https://openalex.org/W6631362777', 'https://openalex.org/W2122931774', 'https://openalex.org/W2963812242', 'https://openalex.org/W2894835365', 'https://openalex.org/W3198429080', 'https://openalex.org/W2671812860', 'https://openalex.org/W4246402807', 'https://openalex.org/W1539673959', 'https://openalex.org/W2749581528', 'https://openalex.org/W3094800360', 'https://openalex.org/W1524333225', 'https://openalex.org/W3037057938', 'https://openalex.org/W3031412205', 'https://openalex.org/W2963587345', 'https://openalex.org/W3104502794', 'https://openalex.org/W2751936342', 'https://openalex.org/W2963403868', 'https://openalex.org/W2626778328', 'https://openalex.org/W2964121744', 'https://openalex.org/W3114727685', 'https://openalex.org/W4235669915', 'https://openalex.org/W2496616370', 'https://openalex.org/W3012900830', 'https://openalex.org/W3013246586', 'https://openalex.org/W4385245566', 'https://openalex.org/W3107298252']",2021-04-28

Therefore, it is unclear whether the self-supervised framework is effective in recognizing other languages with different writing systems, such as Korean which uses the Hangul having a unique writing system. In this paper, we present K-Wav2Vec 2.0, which is a modified version of Wav2vec 2.0 designed for Korean automatic speech recognition by exploring and optimizing various factors of the original Wav2vec 2.0. In fine-tuning, we propose a multi-task hierarchical architecture to reflect the Korean writing structure. Moreover, a joint decoder is applied to alleviate the problem of words existing outside of the vocabulary. In pre-training, we attempted the cross-lingual transfer of the pre-trained model by further pre-training the English Wav2vec 2.0 on a Korean dataset, considering limited resources. Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method yields the best performance on both Korean ASR datasets: Ksponspeech (a large-scale Korean speech corpus) and Clovacall (a call-based dialog corpus). Further pre-training is also effective in language adaptation, leading to large improvements without additional data.","['https://openalex.org/W2964172053', 'https://openalex.org/W3096899423', 'https://openalex.org/W2884975363', 'https://openalex.org/W3091427154', 'https://openalex.org/W2193413348', 'https://openalex.org/W3163702140', 'https://openalex.org/W3005680577', 'https://openalex.org/W3037057938', 'https://openalex.org/W2964121744', 'https://openalex.org/W2962780374', 'https://openalex.org/W2739883972', 'https://openalex.org/W2884254529', 'https://openalex.org/W1494198834', 'https://openalex.org/W2127141656', 'https://openalex.org/W2890197052', 'https://openalex.org/W3124030384', 'https://openalex.org/W2963341956', 'https://openalex.org/W2992095114', 'https://openalex.org/W3000083466', 'https://openalex.org/W3099782249', 'https://openalex.org/W2787663903', 'https://openalex.org/W2327501763', 'https://openalex.org/W2769205094', 'https://openalex.org/W3083353586', 'https://openalex.org/W3016181583', 'https://openalex.org/W2973049979', 'https://openalex.org/W2965373594']",2022-09-16

Once deployed, a ML model needs to be watched and constantly supervised and debugged to guarantee its validity and robustness in unexpected situations. Debugging in ML aims to identify (and address) the model weaknesses in not trivial contexts. Several techniques have been proposed to identify different types of model weaknesses, such as bias in classification, model decay, adversarial attacks, etc., yet there is not a generic framework that allows them to work in a collaborative, modular, portable, iterative way and, more importantly, flexible enough to allow both human- and machine-driven techniques. In this paper, we propose a novel containerized directed graph framework to support and accelerate end-to-end ML workflow management, supervision, and debugging. The framework allows defining and deploying ML workflows in containers, tracking their metadata, checking their behavior in production, and improving the models by using both learned and human-provided knowledge. We demonstrate these capabilities by integrating in the framework two hybrid systems to detect data drift distribution which identify the samples that are far from the latent space of the original distribution, ask for human intervention, and whether retrain the model or wrap it with a filter to remove the noise of corrupted data at inference time. We test these systems on MNIST-C, CIFAR-10-C, and FashionMNIST-C datasets, obtaining promising accuracy results with the help of human involvement.","['https://openalex.org/W6752771859', 'https://openalex.org/W2163922914', 'https://openalex.org/W6600428322', 'https://openalex.org/W2017257315', 'https://openalex.org/W6725811047', 'https://openalex.org/W6676297131', 'https://openalex.org/W2099419573', 'https://openalex.org/W6754561974', 'https://openalex.org/W2962772482', 'https://openalex.org/W2613574453', 'https://openalex.org/W6735804486', 'https://openalex.org/W6761839128', 'https://openalex.org/W2618530766', 'https://openalex.org/W6650119170', 'https://openalex.org/W6632100814', 'https://openalex.org/W6639478124', 'https://openalex.org/W6697144307', 'https://openalex.org/W6766978945', 'https://openalex.org/W6628973269', 'https://openalex.org/W6682610290', 'https://openalex.org/W2117539524', 'https://openalex.org/W6687241523', 'https://openalex.org/W2103104224', 'https://openalex.org/W6637162671', 'https://openalex.org/W6657028776', 'https://openalex.org/W2244109919', 'https://openalex.org/W1502957213', 'https://openalex.org/W2901122692', 'https://openalex.org/W3030163527', 'https://openalex.org/W2913556077', 'https://openalex.org/W4288404646', 'https://openalex.org/W2025768430', 'https://openalex.org/W2108598243', 'https://openalex.org/W2962872506', 'https://openalex.org/W2964308564', 'https://openalex.org/W1981276685', 'https://openalex.org/W2913668833', 'https://openalex.org/W2888580379', 'https://openalex.org/W2900812411', 'https://openalex.org/W2133564696', 'https://openalex.org/W2296335794', 'https://openalex.org/W1652505363', 'https://openalex.org/W2271840356', 'https://openalex.org/W2989818084', 'https://openalex.org/W3005742798', 'https://openalex.org/W2775461895', 'https://openalex.org/W3004223849', 'https://openalex.org/W2002011878', 'https://openalex.org/W2124776405', 'https://openalex.org/W4292779060', 'https://openalex.org/W4200329523', 'https://openalex.org/W3037057938', 'https://openalex.org/W2963076808', 'https://openalex.org/W2915480215', 'https://openalex.org/W2982767129', 'https://openalex.org/W3118608800', 'https://openalex.org/W4234552385', 'https://openalex.org/W2953388933', 'https://openalex.org/W4300511536', 'https://openalex.org/W2750384547', 'https://openalex.org/W1970092758', 'https://openalex.org/W2512971201', 'https://openalex.org/W9657784', 'https://openalex.org/W4301599248', 'https://openalex.org/W4287824528', 'https://openalex.org/W2963446712', 'https://openalex.org/W3198429080', 'https://openalex.org/W4235916601', 'https://openalex.org/W2911495555', 'https://openalex.org/W4365393081', 'https://openalex.org/W2912283112', 'https://openalex.org/W2963060032']",2022-04-19

A promising new application of BCI technology has focused on speech restoration. One approach is to synthesize speech from the neural correlates of a person who cannot speak, as they attempt to do so. However, there is no established gold-standard for quantifying the quality of BCI-synthesized speech. Quantitative metrics, such as applying correlation coefficients between true and decoded speech, are not applicable to anarthric users and fail to capture intelligibility by actual human listeners; by contrast, methods involving people completing forced-choice multiple-choice questionnaires are imprecise, not practical at scale, and cannot be used as cost functions for improving speech decoding algorithms. Here, we present a deep learning-based ""AI Listener"" that can be used to evaluate BCI speech intelligibility objectively, rapidly, and automatically. We begin by adapting several leading Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) deep learning models - Deepspeech, Wav2vec 2.0, and Kaldi - to suit our application. We then evaluate the performance of these ASRs on multiple speech datasets with varying levels of intelligibility, including: healthy speech, speech from people with dysarthria, and synthesized BCI speech. Our results demonstrate that the multiple-language ASR model XLSR-Wav2vec 2.0, trained to output phonemes, yields superior performance in terms of speech transcription accuracy. Notably, the AI Listener reports that several previously published BCI output datasets are not intelligible, which is consistent with human listeners.","['https://openalex.org/W2140360678', 'https://openalex.org/W4200300291', 'https://openalex.org/W180052447', 'https://openalex.org/W1494198834', 'https://openalex.org/W3109832790', 'https://openalex.org/W3161343553', 'https://openalex.org/W6719401913', 'https://openalex.org/W2981852735', 'https://openalex.org/W1922655562', 'https://openalex.org/W3204224625', 'https://openalex.org/W2991284028', 'https://openalex.org/W2940585064', 'https://openalex.org/W3037057938', 'https://openalex.org/W1524333225', 'https://openalex.org/W4322714819', 'https://openalex.org/W4288089799', 'https://openalex.org/W2015441235', 'https://openalex.org/W2462780241', 'https://openalex.org/W3198429080']",2023-04-24

More precisely, we propose innovative approaches that address the low-resource property of these languages. For both monolingual and multilingual systems, our methods rely on self-supervised pre-trained models for multiple languages. We tested our method on seven African languages and dialects: Amharic, Darija, Fongbe, Sudanese, Swahili, Wolof, and Yoruba. We first trained monolingual models that were used as baselines, and then proposed proof-of-concepts for systems that handle multiple languages. Our multilingual systems were based on three scenarios: (a) we trained a single model by concate-nating the multilingual corpora; (b) we discussed this first model by testing another joint model that predicts the spoken language using language-specific tokens before the text transcription; and (c) we fed a one-hot encoder vector to the latent feature extractions before training the single model and for inference. For this purpose, a language identification model is required. We also investigated the impact of lexical ambiguity by removing diacritics from text in some languages.","['https://openalex.org/W2110911455', 'https://openalex.org/W2769180089', 'https://openalex.org/W2770604845', 'https://openalex.org/W2572097499', 'https://openalex.org/W2897369970', 'https://openalex.org/W2524544624', 'https://openalex.org/W2127141656', 'https://openalex.org/W3213029956', 'https://openalex.org/W2786672974', 'https://openalex.org/W4285265369', 'https://openalex.org/W1922655562', 'https://openalex.org/W2193413348', 'https://openalex.org/W2896457183', 'https://openalex.org/W3021268743', 'https://openalex.org/W4200416755', 'https://openalex.org/W2939710050', 'https://openalex.org/W3037057938', 'https://openalex.org/W3158394340', 'https://openalex.org/W2108978495', 'https://openalex.org/W3215667245', 'https://openalex.org/W3216017440', 'https://openalex.org/W2094544353', 'https://openalex.org/W3092791109', 'https://openalex.org/W6662183122', 'https://openalex.org/W2919115771', 'https://openalex.org/W2163605009', 'https://openalex.org/W6739901393', 'https://openalex.org/W3158058158', 'https://openalex.org/W2403246322', 'https://openalex.org/W1637570796', 'https://openalex.org/W3167533889', 'https://openalex.org/W6746214216', 'https://openalex.org/W2578746142', 'https://openalex.org/W3207041304', 'https://openalex.org/W2971840980', 'https://openalex.org/W4385245566', 'https://openalex.org/W2973049979', 'https://openalex.org/W3174056976', 'https://openalex.org/W3098466758', 'https://openalex.org/W2618530766', 'https://openalex.org/W2160802179', 'https://openalex.org/W4281492411', 'https://openalex.org/W3198429080', 'https://openalex.org/W2963590452', 'https://openalex.org/W2106445473']",2023-03-20

The DPAM approach of Manocha et al. learns a full-reference metric trained directly on human judgments, and thus correlates well with human perception. However, it requires a large number of human annotations and does not generalize well outside the range of perturbations on which it was trained. This paper introduces CDPAM, a metric that builds on and advances DPAM. The primary improvement is to combine contrastive learning and multi-dimensional representations to build robust models from limited data. In addition, we collect human judgments on triplet comparisons to improve generalization to a broader range of audio perturbations. CDPAM correlates well with human responses across nine varied datasets. We also show that adding this metric to existing speech synthesis and enhancement methods yields significant improvement, as measured by objective and subjective tests.","['https://openalex.org/W6772622344', 'https://openalex.org/W2105921478', 'https://openalex.org/W3096159803', 'https://openalex.org/W2940385941', 'https://openalex.org/W6631190155', 'https://openalex.org/W2757519008', 'https://openalex.org/W6917585676', 'https://openalex.org/W2140828385', 'https://openalex.org/W3097945073', 'https://openalex.org/W2946896833', 'https://openalex.org/W6756824971', 'https://openalex.org/W2892129657', 'https://openalex.org/W6779919476', 'https://openalex.org/W2964287480', 'https://openalex.org/W2163922914', 'https://openalex.org/W3015829441', 'https://openalex.org/W6756205873', 'https://openalex.org/W2890983311', 'https://openalex.org/W2972394484', 'https://openalex.org/W2737697117', 'https://openalex.org/W1728888090', 'https://openalex.org/W2940290905', 'https://openalex.org/W6729924827', 'https://openalex.org/W3090098535', 'https://openalex.org/W6762114000', 'https://openalex.org/W6767111847', 'https://openalex.org/W3097934054', 'https://openalex.org/W2963830550', 'https://openalex.org/W6844194202', 'https://openalex.org/W2951974815', 'https://openalex.org/W2973049979', 'https://openalex.org/W6777232839', 'https://openalex.org/W6774314701', 'https://openalex.org/W3096656254', 'https://openalex.org/W3037057938', 'https://openalex.org/W2557915412', 'https://openalex.org/W2899775901', 'https://openalex.org/W2943895317', 'https://openalex.org/W3002439978', 'https://openalex.org/W2964121744', 'https://openalex.org/W2842511635', 'https://openalex.org/W3034978746', 'https://openalex.org/W2970006822', 'https://openalex.org/W2473388484', 'https://openalex.org/W2796495654', 'https://openalex.org/W2902476877', 'https://openalex.org/W3025035610', 'https://openalex.org/W2795409001', 'https://openalex.org/W2086381917', 'https://openalex.org/W2971127577']",2021-05-13

Two test sets were released for evaluating the participating systems. One containing pairs for each of the training languages (systems were evaluated in a monolingual fashion) and the other proposing a surprise language to test the crosslingual transfer capabilities of the systems.

The study leverages a new resource put forth in this work, termed MInDS-14, a first training and evaluation resource for the intent detection task with spoken data. It covers 14 intents extracted from a commercial system in the e-banking domain, associated with spoken examples in 14 diverse language varieties. Our key results indicate that combining machine translation models with state-of-the-art multilingual sentence encoders (e.g., LaBSE) can yield strong intent detectors in the majority of target languages covered in MInDS-14, and offer comparative analyses across different axes: e.g., zero-shot versus few-shot learning, translation direction, and impact of speech recognition. We see this work as an important step towards more inclusive development and evaluation of multilingual intent detectors from spoken data, in a much wider spectrum of languages compared to prior work.","['https://openalex.org/W3168656614', 'https://openalex.org/W3045492832', 'https://openalex.org/W2970283086', 'https://openalex.org/W1665214252', 'https://openalex.org/W2810095012', 'https://openalex.org/W2891177506', 'https://openalex.org/W3096032230', 'https://openalex.org/W3103425602', 'https://openalex.org/W3038033387', 'https://openalex.org/W2963854351', 'https://openalex.org/W2898700502', 'https://openalex.org/W88081813', 'https://openalex.org/W2963341956', 'https://openalex.org/W2948110372', 'https://openalex.org/W3037057938', 'https://openalex.org/W2970618241', 'https://openalex.org/W2966087730', 'https://openalex.org/W2953958347', 'https://openalex.org/W2077302143', 'https://openalex.org/W2095705004', 'https://openalex.org/W2997771882', 'https://openalex.org/W3144596436', 'https://openalex.org/W2898856000', 'https://openalex.org/W2969574947', 'https://openalex.org/W3104078590', 'https://openalex.org/W2097550833', 'https://openalex.org/W2964121744']",2021-01-01

However, the cross-entropy loss has several shortcomings that can lead to sub-optimal generalization and instability. Driven by the intuition that good generalization requires capturing the similarity between examples in one class and contrasting them with examples in other classes, we propose a supervised contrastive learning (SCL) objective for the fine-tuning stage. Combined with cross-entropy, our proposed SCL loss obtains significant improvements over a strong RoBERTa-Large baseline on multiple datasets of the GLUE benchmark in few-shot learning settings, without requiring specialized architecture, data augmentations, memory banks, or additional unsupervised data. Our proposed fine-tuning objective leads to models that are more robust to different levels of noise in the fine-tuning training data, and can generalize better to related tasks with limited labeled data.","['https://openalex.org/W2963656735', 'https://openalex.org/W2138204974', 'https://openalex.org/W3034978746', 'https://openalex.org/W3102631365', 'https://openalex.org/W2944828972', 'https://openalex.org/W3035524453', 'https://openalex.org/W2913881544', 'https://openalex.org/W2117539524', 'https://openalex.org/W2973562770', 'https://openalex.org/W2887997457', 'https://openalex.org/W3043462782', 'https://openalex.org/W2963759070', 'https://openalex.org/W1544827683', 'https://openalex.org/W2965373594', 'https://openalex.org/W3035160371', 'https://openalex.org/W2171849160', 'https://openalex.org/W2183341477', 'https://openalex.org/W2970206392', 'https://openalex.org/W2963012544', 'https://openalex.org/W3099782249', 'https://openalex.org/W1821462560', 'https://openalex.org/W2963341956', 'https://openalex.org/W3035204084', 'https://openalex.org/W2194775991', 'https://openalex.org/W3100345210', 'https://openalex.org/W2293778248', 'https://openalex.org/W2943152387', 'https://openalex.org/W3026732421', 'https://openalex.org/W2963399829', 'https://openalex.org/W3034781633', 'https://openalex.org/W3108655343', 'https://openalex.org/W2963060032', 'https://openalex.org/W2971155163', 'https://openalex.org/W2917551568', 'https://openalex.org/W2964013229', 'https://openalex.org/W2962788840', 'https://openalex.org/W3034709122', 'https://openalex.org/W2788496822', 'https://openalex.org/W2798991696', 'https://openalex.org/W2889326796', 'https://openalex.org/W2842511635', 'https://openalex.org/W3010874390', 'https://openalex.org/W1840435438', 'https://openalex.org/W2163614729', 'https://openalex.org/W2097732278', 'https://openalex.org/W2962369866', 'https://openalex.org/W2963026768', 'https://openalex.org/W3118608800', 'https://openalex.org/W2970941190', 'https://openalex.org/W2933138175', 'https://openalex.org/W2949736877', 'https://openalex.org/W3005700362', 'https://openalex.org/W3034850762', 'https://openalex.org/W2555897561', 'https://openalex.org/W3100859887', 'https://openalex.org/W2913939497', 'https://openalex.org/W2992308087', 'https://openalex.org/W3099206234', 'https://openalex.org/W3037057938', 'https://openalex.org/W2963310665']",2020-11-03

The resultant representations can capture information more correlated with phonetic structures and improve the generalization across languages and domains. We evaluate the effectiveness of UniSpeech for cross-lingual representation learning on public CommonVoice corpus. The results show that UniSpeech outperforms self-supervised pretraining and supervised transfer learning for speech recognition by a maximum of 13.4% and 17.8% relative phone error rate reductions respectively (averaged over all testing languages). The transferability of UniSpeech is also demonstrated on a domain-shift speech recognition task, i.e., a relative word error rate reduction of 6% against the previous approach.","['https://openalex.org/W2842511635', 'https://openalex.org/W2547875792', 'https://openalex.org/W2995929068', 'https://openalex.org/W2286443923', 'https://openalex.org/W3032859754', 'https://openalex.org/W3095184753', 'https://openalex.org/W3197411683', 'https://openalex.org/W2973157397', 'https://openalex.org/W3099782249', 'https://openalex.org/W2127141656', 'https://openalex.org/W2025401819', 'https://openalex.org/W3024182269', 'https://openalex.org/W3005511757', 'https://openalex.org/W3015213852', 'https://openalex.org/W2952509486', 'https://openalex.org/W2533523411', 'https://openalex.org/W1994606281', 'https://openalex.org/W2996383576', 'https://openalex.org/W1828163288', 'https://openalex.org/W2951974815', 'https://openalex.org/W2963341956', 'https://openalex.org/W3125709657', 'https://openalex.org/W2963303951', 'https://openalex.org/W2626778328', 'https://openalex.org/W2982223350', 'https://openalex.org/W3037057938', 'https://openalex.org/W1494198834', 'https://openalex.org/W2327501763', 'https://openalex.org/W2025198378', 'https://openalex.org/W3102342027', 'https://openalex.org/W1992475611', 'https://openalex.org/W2294108103', 'https://openalex.org/W2972943112', 'https://openalex.org/W3015265920', 'https://openalex.org/W2962760690', 'https://openalex.org/W2795935804', 'https://openalex.org/W3101648800', 'https://openalex.org/W3094963205', 'https://openalex.org/W3094637009', 'https://openalex.org/W2055884980', 'https://openalex.org/W2973049979']",2021-01-19

The common wisdom is that SSL helps resource-limited tasks in which only a limited amount of labeled data is available. The benefit of SSL keeps diminishing when the labeled training data amount increases. To our best knowledge, at most a few thousand hours of labeled data was used in the study of SSL. In contrast, the industry usually uses tens of thousands of hours of labeled data to build high-accuracy speech recognition (ASR) systems for resource-rich languages. In this study, we take the challenge to investigate whether and how SSL can improve the ASR accuracy of a state-of-the-art production-scale Transformer-Transducer model, which was built with 65 thousand hours of anonymized labeled EN-US data.","['https://openalex.org/W3024182269', 'https://openalex.org/W2963925437', 'https://openalex.org/W2972943112', 'https://openalex.org/W2963523217', 'https://openalex.org/W3099782249', 'https://openalex.org/W3125709657', 'https://openalex.org/W2127141656', 'https://openalex.org/W3016181583', 'https://openalex.org/W3102342027', 'https://openalex.org/W3015194534', 'https://openalex.org/W3121299949', 'https://openalex.org/W3093579165', 'https://openalex.org/W2842511635', 'https://openalex.org/W2508418541', 'https://openalex.org/W2963631907', 'https://openalex.org/W3094667432', 'https://openalex.org/W2997347790', 'https://openalex.org/W2963376890', 'https://openalex.org/W2996383576', 'https://openalex.org/W3161873870', 'https://openalex.org/W2951974815', 'https://openalex.org/W3160525311', 'https://openalex.org/W1828163288', 'https://openalex.org/W2982413405', 'https://openalex.org/W3015265920', 'https://openalex.org/W3016010032', 'https://openalex.org/W2626778328', 'https://openalex.org/W3037057938', 'https://openalex.org/W2160815625', 'https://openalex.org/W2982223350', 'https://openalex.org/W3139918052', 'https://openalex.org/W2973049979', 'https://openalex.org/W3165666670']",2021-07-12

Due to their irregular pronunciation compared to native German words, automatically generated pronunciation dictionaries often contain incorrect phoneme sequences for Anglicisms. In this work, we propose a multitask sequence-to-sequence approach for grapheme-to-phoneme conversion to improve the phonetization of Anglicisms. We extended a grapheme-to-phoneme model with a classification task to distinguish Anglicisms from native German words. With this approach, the model learns to generate different pronunciations depending on the classification result. We used our model to create supplementary Anglicism pronunciation dictionaries to be added to an existing German speech recognition model. Tested on a special Anglicism evaluation set, we improved the recognition of Anglicisms compared to a baseline model, reducing the word error rate by a relative 1 % and the Anglicism error rate by a relative 3 %. With our experiment, we show that multitask learning can help solving the challenge of Anglicisms in German speech recognition.","['https://openalex.org/W1614862348', 'https://openalex.org/W2968767118', 'https://openalex.org/W2250896178', 'https://openalex.org/W2090755665', 'https://openalex.org/W3037057938', 'https://openalex.org/W2963299674', 'https://openalex.org/W3099782249', 'https://openalex.org/W3098824823', 'https://openalex.org/W2964934899', 'https://openalex.org/W2130942839', 'https://openalex.org/W2748157908', 'https://openalex.org/W2064675550', 'https://openalex.org/W1895132741']",2022-01-01

To streamline this routine process, we propose a deep neural network capable of captioning cardiac signals; it receives a cardiac signal as input and generates a clinical report as output. We extend this further to generate multilingual reports. To that end, we create and make publicly available a multilingual clinical report dataset. In the absence of sufficient labelled data, deep neural networks can benefit from a warm-start, or pre-training, procedure in which parameters are first learned in an arbitrary task. We propose such a task in the form of discriminative multilingual pre-training where tokens from clinical reports are randomly replaced with those from other languages and the network is tasked with predicting the language of all tokens. We show that our method performs on par with state-of-the-art pre-training methods such as MLM, ELECTRA, and MARGE, while simultaneously generating diverse and plausible clinical reports. We also demonstrate that multilingual models can outperform their monolingual counterparts, informally terming this beneficial phenomenon as the blessing of multilinguality.","['https://openalex.org/W2971310675', 'https://openalex.org/W2965373594', 'https://openalex.org/W2970049541', 'https://openalex.org/W2932592714', 'https://openalex.org/W3013838212', 'https://openalex.org/W2963456134', 'https://openalex.org/W2963341956', 'https://openalex.org/W2101105183', 'https://openalex.org/W2017086716', 'https://openalex.org/W2983040767', 'https://openalex.org/W3021394814', 'https://openalex.org/W3037854022', 'https://openalex.org/W67279148', 'https://openalex.org/W3016672431', 'https://openalex.org/W2929309437', 'https://openalex.org/W2963967185', 'https://openalex.org/W2970971581', 'https://openalex.org/W3091546937', 'https://openalex.org/W3017454464', 'https://openalex.org/W2937845937', 'https://openalex.org/W2123301721', 'https://openalex.org/W2560730294', 'https://openalex.org/W2911489562', 'https://openalex.org/W1514535095', 'https://openalex.org/W3040454670', 'https://openalex.org/W3013571468', 'https://openalex.org/W2154652894', 'https://openalex.org/W2971863715', 'https://openalex.org/W3027572331', 'https://openalex.org/W3095349973', 'https://openalex.org/W2885851583', 'https://openalex.org/W3034727271', 'https://openalex.org/W2984008963', 'https://openalex.org/W2914397182', 'https://openalex.org/W3015962271', 'https://openalex.org/W3107826490', 'https://openalex.org/W3016252650', 'https://openalex.org/W2970608575', 'https://openalex.org/W2953109491', 'https://openalex.org/W2981851019', 'https://openalex.org/W2958953787', 'https://openalex.org/W2075784151', 'https://openalex.org/W2745461083', 'https://openalex.org/W2041806027', 'https://openalex.org/W2942105358', 'https://openalex.org/W3037057938']",2021-03-19

In audio/speech signal processing, a wide\nrange of features where engineered through decades of research efforts. As it\nturns out, learning to predict such features (a.k.a pseudo-labels) has proven\nto be a particularly relevant pretext task, leading to useful self-supervised\nrepresentations which prove to be effective for downstream tasks. However,\nmethods and common practices for combining such pretext tasks for better\nperformance on the downstream task have not been explored and understood\nproperly. In fact, the process relies almost exclusively on a computationally\nheavy experimental procedure, which becomes intractable with the increase of\nthe number of pretext tasks. This paper introduces a method to select a group\nof pretext tasks among a set of candidates. The method we propose estimates\ncalibrated weights for the partial losses corresponding to the considered\npretext tasks during the self-supervised training process. The experiments\nconducted on automatic speech recognition, speaker and emotion recognition\nvalidate our approach, as the groups selected and weighted with our method\nperform better than classic baselines, thus facilitating the selection and\ncombination of relevant pseudo-labels for self-supervised representation\nlearning.\n","['https://openalex.org/W2758739367', 'https://openalex.org/W2963123301', 'https://openalex.org/W3023371261', 'https://openalex.org/W2890964092', 'https://openalex.org/W3096485810', 'https://openalex.org/W3042860357', 'https://openalex.org/W3103005696', 'https://openalex.org/W3157923770', 'https://openalex.org/W2755891984', 'https://openalex.org/W3034978746', 'https://openalex.org/W3040260790', 'https://openalex.org/W2990704537', 'https://openalex.org/W3189296823', 'https://openalex.org/W3035060554', 'https://openalex.org/W3093579165', 'https://openalex.org/W2242632974', 'https://openalex.org/W2407151108', 'https://openalex.org/W1494198834', 'https://openalex.org/W3096587983', 'https://openalex.org/W2973157397', 'https://openalex.org/W2926827382', 'https://openalex.org/W3046882683', 'https://openalex.org/W3099782249', 'https://openalex.org/W1589137271', 'https://openalex.org/W2290689761', 'https://openalex.org/W2146334809', 'https://openalex.org/W3120044914', 'https://openalex.org/W3037057938', 'https://openalex.org/W2138019504', 'https://openalex.org/W2994633389', 'https://openalex.org/W2982223350', 'https://openalex.org/W3213380193', 'https://openalex.org/W2321533354', 'https://openalex.org/W3160799772', 'https://openalex.org/W3131755153', 'https://openalex.org/W2889313720', 'https://openalex.org/W1796128977', 'https://openalex.org/W2940256401', 'https://openalex.org/W2143426320', 'https://openalex.org/W2982303846', 'https://openalex.org/W2996905456', 'https://openalex.org/W2971155163', 'https://openalex.org/W2957946919', 'https://openalex.org/W2110709236', 'https://openalex.org/W343636949', 'https://openalex.org/W3156691089', 'https://openalex.org/W3015213852', 'https://openalex.org/W2112552549', 'https://openalex.org/W2085662862', 'https://openalex.org/W2842511635', 'https://openalex.org/W2090042521', 'https://openalex.org/W3210177631', 'https://openalex.org/W2787672622', 'https://openalex.org/W3090196146', 'https://openalex.org/W2962835968', 'https://openalex.org/W2750912449', 'https://openalex.org/W3093563057', 'https://openalex.org/W3096196861', 'https://openalex.org/W3036982689', 'https://openalex.org/W2100643000', 'https://openalex.org/W3036601975', 'https://openalex.org/W3198275944', 'https://openalex.org/W2402146185', 'https://openalex.org/W2995480165', 'https://openalex.org/W108866686', 'https://openalex.org/W3030437843', 'https://openalex.org/W2996428491', 'https://openalex.org/W3197411683', 'https://openalex.org/W2951585248', 'https://openalex.org/W2899260162', 'https://openalex.org/W2798512429', 'https://openalex.org/W2747874407', 'https://openalex.org/W3096715616', 'https://openalex.org/W2395899413', 'https://openalex.org/W2154462399', 'https://openalex.org/W3033038061', 'https://openalex.org/W1542637018', 'https://openalex.org/W2963115079', 'https://openalex.org/W3160719641', 'https://openalex.org/W2150772522', 'https://openalex.org/W3106428938', 'https://openalex.org/W2154053567', 'https://openalex.org/W3034781633', 'https://openalex.org/W2962742544']",2021-07-01

Cross-lingual transfer offers a compelling way to help bridge this digital divide by incorporating high-resource data into low-resource systems. Current cross-lingual algorithms have shown success in text-based tasks and speech-related tasks over some low-resource languages. However, scaling up speech systems to support hundreds of low-resource languages remains unsolved. To help bridge this gap, we propose a language similarity approach that can efficiently identify acoustic cross-lingual transfer pairs across hundreds of languages. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in language family classification, speech recognition, and speech synthesis tasks.","['https://openalex.org/W2963609956', 'https://openalex.org/W3153849864', 'https://openalex.org/W3025165719', 'https://openalex.org/W3037057938', 'https://openalex.org/W2524541983', 'https://openalex.org/W3096032230', 'https://openalex.org/W2952289666', 'https://openalex.org/W2903739847', 'https://openalex.org/W2964309797', 'https://openalex.org/W3198694222', 'https://openalex.org/W3016160783', 'https://openalex.org/W2396466159', 'https://openalex.org/W2972818416', 'https://openalex.org/W2998284473', 'https://openalex.org/W3167335398', 'https://openalex.org/W2058094241', 'https://openalex.org/W202879582', 'https://openalex.org/W3030437843', 'https://openalex.org/W3035390927', 'https://openalex.org/W256536324', 'https://openalex.org/W803770162', 'https://openalex.org/W3142087749', 'https://openalex.org/W2408021097', 'https://openalex.org/W2963403868', 'https://openalex.org/W2396312253', 'https://openalex.org/W3109527089', 'https://openalex.org/W3206808041', 'https://openalex.org/W2786835190', 'https://openalex.org/W2972581290', 'https://openalex.org/W61749939', 'https://openalex.org/W2107860279', 'https://openalex.org/W2895676041', 'https://openalex.org/W3096215352', 'https://openalex.org/W3101000907', 'https://openalex.org/W2962780374', 'https://openalex.org/W1494198834', 'https://openalex.org/W2936774411', 'https://openalex.org/W2937197076', 'https://openalex.org/W2273653065', 'https://openalex.org/W273093436', 'https://openalex.org/W3198958373', 'https://openalex.org/W2716988359', 'https://openalex.org/W3095410713', 'https://openalex.org/W2726515241', 'https://openalex.org/W2998653236', 'https://openalex.org/W1566883001', 'https://openalex.org/W2963292011', 'https://openalex.org/W2963431393', 'https://openalex.org/W2739967986', 'https://openalex.org/W2807627734', 'https://openalex.org/W3100345210', 'https://openalex.org/W2972608701']",2021-11-02

However, emo- tions may vary by culture and language, and resources in Italian are scarce. To address this gap, we launched a crowdsourcing campaign and obtained Emozionalmente, a corpus of 6902 samples produced by 431 non-professional Italian speakers verbalizing 18 sentences expressing the Big Six emotions and neutrality. We conducted a subjective validation of Emozionalmente by asking 829 humans to guess the emotion expressed in the audio clips, achieving an overall accuracy of 66%. Additionally, we fine- tuned the deep learning wav2vec 2.0 model on Emozionalmente and achieved good performance, with an accuracy of around 81- 83%. In this paper, we describe the design choices, a descriptive analysis of the corpus, and the methodology and results of the behavioral and computational studies conducted on the dataset.

However, the scarcity of human-labeled data for languages beyond English poses a significant challenge in developing such systems. In this work, we propose a Language-Independent scoring approach to evaluate speech without relying on labeled data in the target language. We introduce a multilingual speech scoring system that leverages representations from the wav2vec 2.0 XLSR model and a force-alignment technique based on CTC-Segmentation to construct speech features. These features are used to train a machine learning model to predict pronunciation and fluency scores. We demonstrate the potential of our method by predicting expert ratings on a speech dataset spanning five languages - English, French, Spanish, German and Portuguese, and comparing its performance against Language-Specific models trained individually on each language, as well as a jointly-trained model on all languages. Results indicate that our approach shows promise as an initial step towards a universal language independent speech scoring.","['https://openalex.org/W2130689396', 'https://openalex.org/W3092539250', 'https://openalex.org/W2995929068', 'https://openalex.org/W4200300291', 'https://openalex.org/W3037057938', 'https://openalex.org/W1988687075', 'https://openalex.org/W2408752745', 'https://openalex.org/W2164810574', 'https://openalex.org/W103312509', 'https://openalex.org/W2786790428', 'https://openalex.org/W2091856355', 'https://openalex.org/W3043783436', 'https://openalex.org/W4283728719', 'https://openalex.org/W1931766939', 'https://openalex.org/W6659418573', 'https://openalex.org/W3011567515', 'https://openalex.org/W2972347929', 'https://openalex.org/W2295209184', 'https://openalex.org/W3204224625', 'https://openalex.org/W2979575266', 'https://openalex.org/W1979364015', 'https://openalex.org/W3198712976', 'https://openalex.org/W3030437843', 'https://openalex.org/W4299785905', 'https://openalex.org/W4322714819', 'https://openalex.org/W2963993537', 'https://openalex.org/W3198429080']",2024-03-24

We identify a need for integrative approaches that go beyond these limitations, and propose to analyse the strengths and weaknesses of current theoretical approaches of language acquisition. In particular, we advocate that language learning simulations, if they integrate realistic input and multiple levels of language, have the potential to contribute significantly to our understanding of language acquisition. We then review recent results obtained through such language learning simulations. Finally, we propose some guidelines for the community to build better simulations.","['https://openalex.org/W2913939165', 'https://openalex.org/W4232516125', 'https://openalex.org/W2064135025', 'https://openalex.org/W2059168261', 'https://openalex.org/W3134108900', 'https://openalex.org/W1532494781', 'https://openalex.org/W2973180715', 'https://openalex.org/W6825992397', 'https://openalex.org/W3161374022', 'https://openalex.org/W2089883580', 'https://openalex.org/W2303872361', 'https://openalex.org/W4206039057', 'https://openalex.org/W2896342372', 'https://openalex.org/W2141038596', 'https://openalex.org/W2917235195', 'https://openalex.org/W1969005071', 'https://openalex.org/W2585893098', 'https://openalex.org/W2483390977', 'https://openalex.org/W4225726571', 'https://openalex.org/W2937297214', 'https://openalex.org/W2125566341', 'https://openalex.org/W833103999', 'https://openalex.org/W2765364385', 'https://openalex.org/W2153897911', 'https://openalex.org/W1968225092', 'https://openalex.org/W2078828996', 'https://openalex.org/W2595479191', 'https://openalex.org/W6800751262', 'https://openalex.org/W1530250655', 'https://openalex.org/W3199093330', 'https://openalex.org/W2060204180', 'https://openalex.org/W135984148', 'https://openalex.org/W6712444837', 'https://openalex.org/W2162505970', 'https://openalex.org/W4242738990', 'https://openalex.org/W2784570041', 'https://openalex.org/W1984586950', 'https://openalex.org/W2759573091', 'https://openalex.org/W4200598898', 'https://openalex.org/W4220770602', 'https://openalex.org/W6809594290', 'https://openalex.org/W3110458199', 'https://openalex.org/W2615444509', 'https://openalex.org/W4292825791', 'https://openalex.org/W4297677272', 'https://openalex.org/W4375868953', 'https://openalex.org/W2435103813', 'https://openalex.org/W2996556191', 'https://openalex.org/W6790356757', 'https://openalex.org/W1997015862', 'https://openalex.org/W4309419356', 'https://openalex.org/W2110221456', 'https://openalex.org/W2163999179', 'https://openalex.org/W2005592929', 'https://openalex.org/W4205897400', 'https://openalex.org/W6648830005', 'https://openalex.org/W2110485445', 'https://openalex.org/W2149932965', 'https://openalex.org/W3197259906', 'https://openalex.org/W3166292821', 'https://openalex.org/W6676025551', 'https://openalex.org/W1540332606', 'https://openalex.org/W1995403064', 'https://openalex.org/W1597121597', 'https://openalex.org/W3023172065', 'https://openalex.org/W2016292361', 'https://openalex.org/W2000977437', 'https://openalex.org/W4311481261', 'https://openalex.org/W2138641981', 'https://openalex.org/W3125087428', 'https://openalex.org/W4253682481', 'https://openalex.org/W2935067899', 'https://openalex.org/W4237938692', 'https://openalex.org/W3005081886', 'https://openalex.org/W2153767712', 'https://openalex.org/W4230725619', 'https://openalex.org/W2103091632', 'https://openalex.org/W2001771035', 'https://openalex.org/W2118373646', 'https://openalex.org/W3171477941', 'https://openalex.org/W2005311247', 'https://openalex.org/W4250883074', 'https://openalex.org/W2343593471', 'https://openalex.org/W4300721020', 'https://openalex.org/W6778883912', 'https://openalex.org/W1980862600', 'https://openalex.org/W3198815374', 'https://openalex.org/W2089358714', 'https://openalex.org/W4394671563', 'https://openalex.org/W2980877534', 'https://openalex.org/W2333023345', 'https://openalex.org/W4210307751', 'https://openalex.org/W593365102', 'https://openalex.org/W2950416202', 'https://openalex.org/W4221038855', 'https://openalex.org/W2107959623', 'https://openalex.org/W2395899413', 'https://openalex.org/W4298742451', 'https://openalex.org/W4292779060', 'https://openalex.org/W2132387635', 'https://openalex.org/W2612271891']",2023-05-29

In deep cluster, we first prepare pseudo-labels obtained by clustering the outputs of a CPC network with k-means. Then, we train an additional autoregressive model to classify the previously obtained pseudo-labels in a supervised manner. Phoneme discriminative representation is achieved by executing the second-round clustering with the outputs of the final layer of the autoregressive model. We show that replacing a Transformer layer with a Conformer layer leads to a further gain in a lexical metric. Experimental results show that a relative improvement of 35% in a phonetic metric, 1.5% in the lexical metric, and 2.3% in a syntactic metric are achieved compared to a baseline method of CPC-small which is trained on LibriSpeech 460h data. We achieve top results in this challenge with the syntactic metric.","['https://openalex.org/W2996383576', 'https://openalex.org/W3096338464', 'https://openalex.org/W3015737168', 'https://openalex.org/W1836465849', 'https://openalex.org/W2964074409', 'https://openalex.org/W2963403868', 'https://openalex.org/W3026041220', 'https://openalex.org/W3016011332', 'https://openalex.org/W3025165719', 'https://openalex.org/W3095783102', 'https://openalex.org/W2973157397', 'https://openalex.org/W2395899413', 'https://openalex.org/W2883725317', 'https://openalex.org/W2842511635', 'https://openalex.org/W1494198834', 'https://openalex.org/W3094800360', 'https://openalex.org/W2064675550', 'https://openalex.org/W3110458199', 'https://openalex.org/W2765741717', 'https://openalex.org/W2982223350', 'https://openalex.org/W2995181338', 'https://openalex.org/W2996728628', 'https://openalex.org/W2965373594', 'https://openalex.org/W2152790380', 'https://openalex.org/W1538131130', 'https://openalex.org/W3093579165', 'https://openalex.org/W3099782249', 'https://openalex.org/W2095705004']",2021-08-27

Do infants rely on simple statistical mechanisms, or do they come pre-wired with innate capabilities allowing them to learn their native language(s)? Previous modeling studies have shown that unsupervised learning algorithms could reproduce some aspects of infant phonetic learning. Despite these successes, algorithms still fail to reproduce the learning trajectories observed in infants. Here, we advocate that this failure is partly due to a wrong initial state. Contrary to infants, unsupervised learning algorithms start with little to no prior knowledge of speech sounds. In this work, we propose a modeling approach to investigate the relative contribution of innate factors and language experience in infant speech perception. Our approach allows us to investigate theories hypothesizing a more significant role of innate factors, offering new modeling opportunities for studying infant language acquisition.","['https://openalex.org/W2214604124', 'https://openalex.org/W2027219560', 'https://openalex.org/W4232516125', 'https://openalex.org/W2548930763', 'https://openalex.org/W2001365213', 'https://openalex.org/W2786031913', 'https://openalex.org/W3015783745', 'https://openalex.org/W4229781645', 'https://openalex.org/W4225815933', 'https://openalex.org/W2765364385', 'https://openalex.org/W4382918397', 'https://openalex.org/W4225726571', 'https://openalex.org/W4378619943', 'https://openalex.org/W3197259906', 'https://openalex.org/W2483390977', 'https://openalex.org/W2050517152', 'https://openalex.org/W2011238950', 'https://openalex.org/W2595479191', 'https://openalex.org/W2593116425', 'https://openalex.org/W2605959375', 'https://openalex.org/W2165545766', 'https://openalex.org/W4230449744', 'https://openalex.org/W2999130843', 'https://openalex.org/W2133189729', 'https://openalex.org/W2995181338', 'https://openalex.org/W1597121597', 'https://openalex.org/W3144810982', 'https://openalex.org/W2020944885', 'https://openalex.org/W2103091632', 'https://openalex.org/W2063525438', 'https://openalex.org/W2005311247', 'https://openalex.org/W4311481261', 'https://openalex.org/W4391669171', 'https://openalex.org/W4385822936', 'https://openalex.org/W6791720001', 'https://openalex.org/W3034729383', 'https://openalex.org/W4384626726', 'https://openalex.org/W2104752510', 'https://openalex.org/W2776941264', 'https://openalex.org/W2062956221', 'https://openalex.org/W281094599', 'https://openalex.org/W3110458199', 'https://openalex.org/W2050864369', 'https://openalex.org/W6656414902', 'https://openalex.org/W2113332115', 'https://openalex.org/W2145410271', 'https://openalex.org/W1970688873', 'https://openalex.org/W2010188467', 'https://openalex.org/W2621649611', 'https://openalex.org/W3016181583', 'https://openalex.org/W577928986', 'https://openalex.org/W2615444509', 'https://openalex.org/W3125087428', 'https://openalex.org/W2395899413', 'https://openalex.org/W66627554', 'https://openalex.org/W4303629135', 'https://openalex.org/W1604716266', 'https://openalex.org/W2160464066', 'https://openalex.org/W2003341094', 'https://openalex.org/W1925965306', 'https://openalex.org/W292738443', 'https://openalex.org/W2153767712', 'https://openalex.org/W4238846128', 'https://openalex.org/W4389521008', 'https://openalex.org/W4246559809', 'https://openalex.org/W2037751943', 'https://openalex.org/W2088724121', 'https://openalex.org/W4389519222', 'https://openalex.org/W2024490156', 'https://openalex.org/W598767079', 'https://openalex.org/W4396127524', 'https://openalex.org/W3119308075', 'https://openalex.org/W4297808394', 'https://openalex.org/W3133848337', 'https://openalex.org/W4287591426']",2024-04-23

Such MOS prediction models include MOSNet and LDNet that use spectral features as input, and SSL-MOS that relies on a pretrained self-supervised learning model that directly uses the speech signal as input. In modern high-quality neural TTS systems, prosodic appropriateness with regard to the spoken content is a decisive factor for speech naturalness. For this reason, we propose to include prosodic and linguistic features as additional inputs in MOS prediction systems, and evaluate their impact on the prediction outcome. We consider phoneme level F0 and duration features as prosodic inputs, as well as Tacotron encoder outputs, POS tags and BERT embeddings as higher-level linguistic inputs. All MOS prediction systems are trained on SOMOS, a neural TTS-only dataset with crowdsourced naturalness MOS evaluations. Results show that the proposed additional features are beneficial in the MOS prediction task, by improving the predicted MOS scores' correlation with the ground truths, both at utterance-level and system-level predictions.","['https://openalex.org/W3202278141', 'https://openalex.org/W3198270377', 'https://openalex.org/W4225956675', 'https://openalex.org/W4296068974', 'https://openalex.org/W3095389792', 'https://openalex.org/W3097206152', 'https://openalex.org/W3207932315', 'https://openalex.org/W6865327743', 'https://openalex.org/W2105854852', 'https://openalex.org/W4296068832', 'https://openalex.org/W4223503417', 'https://openalex.org/W4297570641', 'https://openalex.org/W3196225973', 'https://openalex.org/W2895146711', 'https://openalex.org/W3163003432', 'https://openalex.org/W6755207826', 'https://openalex.org/W2963521945', 'https://openalex.org/W6917585676', 'https://openalex.org/W6676245417', 'https://openalex.org/W6776148200', 'https://openalex.org/W2970641574', 'https://openalex.org/W6784545093', 'https://openalex.org/W2972394484', 'https://openalex.org/W2963035245', 'https://openalex.org/W3161558238', 'https://openalex.org/W2511311723', 'https://openalex.org/W70888257', 'https://openalex.org/W2963403924', 'https://openalex.org/W6729924827', 'https://openalex.org/W2896457183', 'https://openalex.org/W4395681663', 'https://openalex.org/W2557915412', 'https://openalex.org/W2107831318', 'https://openalex.org/W3016473712', 'https://openalex.org/W3091928890']",2023-05-05

It utilizes a Tacotron-based multispeaker acoustic model trained on read-only speech data and which provides prosody control at the phoneme level. Dataset augmentation and additional prosody manipulation based on traditional DSP algorithms are also investigated. The neural TTS model is fine-tuned to an unseen speaker's limited recordings, allowing rapping/singing synthesis with the target's speaker voice. The detailed pipeline of the system is described, which includes the extraction of the target pitch and duration values from an a capella song and their conversion into target speaker's valid range of notes before synthesis. An additional stage of prosodic manipulation of the output via WSOLA is also investigated for better matching the target duration values. The synthesized utterances can be mixed with an instrumental accompaniment track to produce a complete song. The proposed system is evaluated via subjective listening tests as well as in comparison to an available alternate system which also aims to produce synthetic singing voice from read-only training data. Results show that the proposed approach can produce high quality rapping/singing voice with increased naturalness.","['https://openalex.org/W2095705004', 'https://openalex.org/W2972473628', 'https://openalex.org/W2946639766', 'https://openalex.org/W1749799732', 'https://openalex.org/W2963609956', 'https://openalex.org/W3082910224', 'https://openalex.org/W3097152652', 'https://openalex.org/W2148228080', 'https://openalex.org/W2409027918', 'https://openalex.org/W29794711', 'https://openalex.org/W1525613233', 'https://openalex.org/W2150658333', 'https://openalex.org/W2964243274', 'https://openalex.org/W3216401400', 'https://openalex.org/W2168510624', 'https://openalex.org/W2536210537', 'https://openalex.org/W3163003432', 'https://openalex.org/W2946200149', 'https://openalex.org/W3015645837', 'https://openalex.org/W2973046048', 'https://openalex.org/W2516406502', 'https://openalex.org/W3095459301', 'https://openalex.org/W3021164770', 'https://openalex.org/W3095389792', 'https://openalex.org/W3081279708', 'https://openalex.org/W2778460379', 'https://openalex.org/W3096437652', 'https://openalex.org/W3133525064', 'https://openalex.org/W3095948607', 'https://openalex.org/W1525954971']",2021-08-24

We begin by observing that, in theory, VAEs can actually represent\nautoregressive models, as well as faster, better models if they exist, when\nmade sufficiently deep. Despite this, autoregressive models have historically\noutperformed VAEs in log-likelihood. We test if insufficient depth explains why\nby scaling a VAE to greater stochastic depth than previously explored and\nevaluating it CIFAR-10, ImageNet, and FFHQ. In comparison to the PixelCNN,\nthese very deep VAEs achieve higher likelihoods, use fewer parameters, generate\nsamples thousands of times faster, and are more easily applied to\nhigh-resolution images. Qualitative studies suggest this is because the VAE\nlearns efficient hierarchical visual representations.

https://openalex.org/W3049247973,https://doi.org/10.48550/arxiv.2008.07142,POP909: A Pop-song Dataset for Music Arrangement Generation,"Music arrangement generation is a subtask of automatic music generation, which involves reconstructing and re-conceptualizing a piece with new compositional techniques. Such a generation process inevitably requires reference from the original melody, chord progression, or other structural information. Despite some promising models for arrangement, they lack more refined data to achieve better evaluations and more practical results. In this paper, we propose POP909, a dataset which contains multiple versions of the piano arrangements of 909 popular songs created by professional musicians. The main body of the dataset contains the vocal melody, the lead instrument melody, and the piano accompaniment for each song in MIDI format, which are aligned to the original audio files. Furthermore, we provide the annotations of tempo, beat, key, and chords, where the tempo curves are hand-labeled and others are done by MIR algorithms. Finally, we conduct several baseline experiments with this dataset using standard deep music generation algorithms.","['https://openalex.org/W2475687244', 'https://openalex.org/W2018738723', 'https://openalex.org/W2919624000', 'https://openalex.org/W2123306325', 'https://openalex.org/W2949382160', 'https://openalex.org/W2591553092', 'https://openalex.org/W2963681776', 'https://openalex.org/W2937519396', 'https://openalex.org/W2962699318', 'https://openalex.org/W1519655822', 'https://openalex.org/W1819710477', 'https://openalex.org/W2396710372', 'https://openalex.org/W2906933017', 'https://openalex.org/W2963985773', 'https://openalex.org/W2903916098', 'https://openalex.org/W2396433901', 'https://openalex.org/W2398002958', 'https://openalex.org/W2964051853', 'https://openalex.org/W2964706117', 'https://openalex.org/W2797595207', 'https://openalex.org/W3112895167', 'https://openalex.org/W2963403868', 'https://openalex.org/W2964121744', 'https://openalex.org/W2991421901', 'https://openalex.org/W103489607', 'https://openalex.org/W2963575853', 'https://openalex.org/W2572771584', 'https://openalex.org/W2898148140', 'https://openalex.org/W3021164770', 'https://openalex.org/W2142996485', 'https://openalex.org/W3005441616', 'https://openalex.org/W2946488335', 'https://openalex.org/W579034728']",2020-08-17
https://openalex.org/W3009948090,,On the Convergence of Adam and Adagrad,"We provide a simple proof of the convergence of the optimization algorithms Adam and Adagrad with the assumptions of smooth gradients and almost sure uniform bound on the $\ell_\infty$ norm of the gradients. This work builds on the techniques introduced by Ward et al. (2019) and extends them to the Adam optimizer. We show that in expectation, the squared norm of the objective gradient averaged over the trajectory has an upper-bound which is explicit in the constants of the problem, parameters of the optimizer and the total number of iterations N. This bound can be made arbitrarily small. In particular, Adam with a learning rate $\alpha=1/\sqrt{N}$ and a momentum parameter on squared gradients $\beta_2=1 - 1/N$ achieves the same rate of convergence $O(\ln(N)/\sqrt{N})$ as Adagrad. Thus, it is possible to use Adam as a finite horizon version of Adagrad, much like constant step size SGD can be used instead of its asymptotically converging decaying step size version.","['https://openalex.org/W2757196798', 'https://openalex.org/W1988720110', 'https://openalex.org/W2964121744', 'https://openalex.org/W2096840748', 'https://openalex.org/W2963450615', 'https://openalex.org/W3021164770', 'https://openalex.org/W2785523195', 'https://openalex.org/W2951395930', 'https://openalex.org/W2963613486', 'https://openalex.org/W2132211083', 'https://openalex.org/W2919115771', 'https://openalex.org/W2619516334', 'https://openalex.org/W2945414017', 'https://openalex.org/W2963563140', 'https://openalex.org/W2106709023', 'https://openalex.org/W2946511237', 'https://openalex.org/W2886463271', 'https://openalex.org/W2337540838', 'https://openalex.org/W2947578309', 'https://openalex.org/W2805767638']",2020-03-05
https://openalex.org/W3169882120,https://doi.org/10.3390/electronics10111349,Stochastic Restoration of Heavily Compressed Musical Audio Using Generative Adversarial Networks,"Lossy audio codecs compress (and decompress) digital audio streams by removing information that tends to be inaudible in human perception. Under high compression rates, such codecs may introduce a variety of impairments in the audio signal. Many works have tackled the problem of audio enhancement and compression artifact removal using deep-learning techniques. However, only a few works tackle the restoration of heavily compressed audio signals in the musical domain. In such a scenario, there is no unique solution for the restoration of the original signal. Therefore, in this study, we test a stochastic generator of a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) architecture for this task. Such a stochastic generator, conditioned on highly compressed musical audio signals, could one day generate outputs indistinguishable from high-quality releases. Therefore, the present study may yield insights into more efficient musical data storage and transmission. We train stochastic and deterministic generators on MP3-compressed audio signals with 16, 32, and 64 kbit/s. We perform an extensive evaluation of the different experiments utilizing objective metrics and listening tests. We find that the models can improve the quality of the audio signals over the MP3 versions for 16 and 32 kbit/s and that the stochastic generators are capable of generating outputs that are closer to the original signals than those of the deterministic generators.","['https://openalex.org/W6633114069', 'https://openalex.org/W6630236247', 'https://openalex.org/W2117497587', 'https://openalex.org/W2711335087', 'https://openalex.org/W2809824582', 'https://openalex.org/W2944079609', 'https://openalex.org/W3015780049', 'https://openalex.org/W6755446875', 'https://openalex.org/W2526733715', 'https://openalex.org/W2998639482', 'https://openalex.org/W3048758284', 'https://openalex.org/W3046669506', 'https://openalex.org/W2100285470', 'https://openalex.org/W1517841224', 'https://openalex.org/W2044893557', 'https://openalex.org/W3006440693', 'https://openalex.org/W2944209089', 'https://openalex.org/W2998498479', 'https://openalex.org/W3081378361', 'https://openalex.org/W4238906441', 'https://openalex.org/W2151667147', 'https://openalex.org/W2167341025', 'https://openalex.org/W1485515796', 'https://openalex.org/W2179369514', 'https://openalex.org/W1590214901', 'https://openalex.org/W1885185971', 'https://openalex.org/W2963073614', 'https://openalex.org/W6741681139', 'https://openalex.org/W2802034954', 'https://openalex.org/W2784918340', 'https://openalex.org/W4245919820', 'https://openalex.org/W4301878342', 'https://openalex.org/W2062164080', 'https://openalex.org/W2586068394', 'https://openalex.org/W2042407743', 'https://openalex.org/W2364134690', 'https://openalex.org/W2128653836', 'https://openalex.org/W1995536493', 'https://openalex.org/W2109349638', 'https://openalex.org/W1999846783', 'https://openalex.org/W2291877678', 'https://openalex.org/W1482149378', 'https://openalex.org/W2600556233', 'https://openalex.org/W2929514213', 'https://openalex.org/W2791210709', 'https://openalex.org/W2963321191', 'https://openalex.org/W2746457594', 'https://openalex.org/W2943895317', 'https://openalex.org/W2998832642', 'https://openalex.org/W2810843531', 'https://openalex.org/W3034771406', 'https://openalex.org/W6738884980', 'https://openalex.org/W3162188526', 'https://openalex.org/W2739748921', 'https://openalex.org/W1903029394', 'https://openalex.org/W1677182931', 'https://openalex.org/W2567070169', 'https://openalex.org/W3022805095', 'https://openalex.org/W6631190155', 'https://openalex.org/W6735913928', 'https://openalex.org/W3118215210', 'https://openalex.org/W6636045042', 'https://openalex.org/W6758675244', 'https://openalex.org/W3127004306', 'https://openalex.org/W2739619458', 'https://openalex.org/W3021164770', 'https://openalex.org/W3096468295', 'https://openalex.org/W2099471712', 'https://openalex.org/W3096159803', 'https://openalex.org/W2618946976', 'https://openalex.org/W2972443522', 'https://openalex.org/W3096408984', 'https://openalex.org/W3102190437', 'https://openalex.org/W1502560247', 'https://openalex.org/W2963453742', 'https://openalex.org/W2605135824', 'https://openalex.org/W1553834069', 'https://openalex.org/W3122318757', 'https://openalex.org/W3097034112', 'https://openalex.org/W2963970792', 'https://openalex.org/W2896030002', 'https://openalex.org/W1606487971', 'https://openalex.org/W2949558265', 'https://openalex.org/W2972785266', 'https://openalex.org/W3093990297', 'https://openalex.org/W2910577860', 'https://openalex.org/W1956021273']",2021-06-05

https://openalex.org/W3118605064,https://doi.org/10.48550/arxiv.2010.00654,VAEBM: A Symbiosis between Variational Autoencoders and Energy-based\n Models,"Energy-based models (EBMs) have recently been successful in representing\ncomplex distributions of small images. However, sampling from them requires\nexpensive Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) iterations that mix slowly in high\ndimensional pixel space. Unlike EBMs, variational autoencoders (VAEs) generate\nsamples quickly and are equipped with a latent space that enables fast\ntraversal of the data manifold. However, VAEs tend to assign high probability\ndensity to regions in data space outside the actual data distribution and often\nfail at generating sharp images. In this paper, we propose VAEBM, a symbiotic\ncomposition of a VAE and an EBM that offers the best of both worlds. VAEBM\ncaptures the overall mode structure of the data distribution using a\nstate-of-the-art VAE and it relies on its EBM component to explicitly exclude\nnon-data-like regions from the model and refine the image samples. Moreover,\nthe VAE component in VAEBM allows us to speed up MCMC updates by\nreparameterizing them in the VAE's latent space.

In the present work, we detail our state-of-the-art Environmental Sound Classification (ESC) framework that is capable of near real-time acoustic categorization directly at the edge. Existing ESC algorithms primarily train and test on pristine datasets that fail in real-world deployments due their inability to handle real-world noisy environments. Methods to denoise the sounds are often computationally expensive for edge devices and do not guarantee performance improvements. To this end, we investigate a way to make existing ESC models robust and make them work in operational resource-constrained settings. Our framework employs a noisy classification model consisting of a tiny BERT-based Transformer (less than 20,000 parameters) and considers hardening of this model through the use of transmission channel noise augmentation. We detail real-world results through its deployment on a Raspberry Pi Zero and demonstrate its classification performance.","['https://openalex.org/W2947469743', 'https://openalex.org/W2052666245', 'https://openalex.org/W2938440247', 'https://openalex.org/W2608696185', 'https://openalex.org/W2052384514', 'https://openalex.org/W2007645738', 'https://openalex.org/W2106265339', 'https://openalex.org/W6789403026', 'https://openalex.org/W2605945764', 'https://openalex.org/W3094175596', 'https://openalex.org/W2895590231', 'https://openalex.org/W2509065397', 'https://openalex.org/W1972567154', 'https://openalex.org/W3023935494', 'https://openalex.org/W6793119350', 'https://openalex.org/W3095348033', 'https://openalex.org/W3022215617', 'https://openalex.org/W2976146944', 'https://openalex.org/W1979594949', 'https://openalex.org/W2803914058', 'https://openalex.org/W3147387781', 'https://openalex.org/W3136991969', 'https://openalex.org/W3217182838', 'https://openalex.org/W4214612132', 'https://openalex.org/W2963341956', 'https://openalex.org/W4287372095', 'https://openalex.org/W2896457183', 'https://openalex.org/W4287802874', 'https://openalex.org/W3098357269', 'https://openalex.org/W2963403868', 'https://openalex.org/W3021164770', 'https://openalex.org/W3124414150', 'https://openalex.org/W4385245566', 'https://openalex.org/W3094502228']",2021-06-14

Although research in deep generative models has dramatically improved the capability and fluency of music models, recent work has shown that it can be challenging for humans to partner with this new class of algorithms. In this paper, we present findings on what 13 musician/developer teams, a total of 61 users, needed when co-creating a song with AI, the challenges they faced, and how they leveraged and repurposed existing characteristics of AI to overcome some of these challenges. Many teams adopted modular approaches, such as independently running multiple smaller models that align with the musical building blocks of a song, before re-combining their results. As ML models are not easily steerable, teams also generated massive numbers of samples and curated them post-hoc, or used a range of strategies to direct the generation or algorithmically ranked the samples. Ultimately, teams not only had to manage the ``flare and focus'' aspects of the creative process, but also juggle that with a parallel process of exploring and curating multiple ML models and outputs. These findings reflect a need to design machine learning-powered music interfaces that are more decomposable, steerable, interpretable, and adaptive, which in return will enable artists to more effectively explore how AI can extend their personal expression.","['https://openalex.org/W2796000004', 'https://openalex.org/W2059216172', 'https://openalex.org/W2753868141', 'https://openalex.org/W2953331651', 'https://openalex.org/W2162514427', 'https://openalex.org/W2115083233', 'https://openalex.org/W2514141612', 'https://openalex.org/W2602896535', 'https://openalex.org/W3005487936', 'https://openalex.org/W2794719876', 'https://openalex.org/W2288593361', 'https://openalex.org/W2957258179', 'https://openalex.org/W3154236293', 'https://openalex.org/W3016014797', 'https://openalex.org/W2905204858', 'https://openalex.org/W3098518646', 'https://openalex.org/W2891794946', 'https://openalex.org/W2949382160', 'https://openalex.org/W3122518304', 'https://openalex.org/W1979290264', 'https://openalex.org/W2805697608', 'https://openalex.org/W2752134738', 'https://openalex.org/W2962212541', 'https://openalex.org/W2142996485', 'https://openalex.org/W2401203361', 'https://openalex.org/W2963403868', 'https://openalex.org/W3031000691', 'https://openalex.org/W3131643527', 'https://openalex.org/W3046715528', 'https://openalex.org/W2795278834', 'https://openalex.org/W2569330962', 'https://openalex.org/W3021164770', 'https://openalex.org/W2963575853', 'https://openalex.org/W2044115095', 'https://openalex.org/W2950429748', 'https://openalex.org/W1983033388', 'https://openalex.org/W3003673875', 'https://openalex.org/W2811079561', 'https://openalex.org/W2950547518', 'https://openalex.org/W147294073', 'https://openalex.org/W1982673570', 'https://openalex.org/W2406069903', 'https://openalex.org/W2963032576', 'https://openalex.org/W3127086053', 'https://openalex.org/W2896197082', 'https://openalex.org/W2153628411', 'https://openalex.org/W1598820975', 'https://openalex.org/W2989822430', 'https://openalex.org/W2790165607', 'https://openalex.org/W161531308', 'https://openalex.org/W2982125965']",2020-10-11
https://openalex.org/W3081378361,https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4245503,DrumGAN: Synthesis of drum sounds with timbral feature conditioning using generative adversarial networks,"Synthetic creation of drum sounds (e.g., in drum machines) is commonly performed using analog or digital synthesis, allowing a musician to sculpt the desired timbre modifying various parameters. Typically, such parameters control low-level features of the sound and often have no musical meaning or perceptual correspondence. With the rise of Deep Learning, data-driven processing of audio emerges as an alternative to traditional signal processing. This new paradigm allows controlling the synthesis process through learned high-level features or by conditioning a model on musically relevant information. In this paper, we apply a Generative Adversarial Network to the task of audio synthesis of drum sounds. By conditioning the model on perceptual features computed with a publicly available feature-extractor, intuitive control is gained over the generation process. The experiments are carried out on a large collection of kick, snare, and cymbal sounds. We show that, compared to a specific prior work based on a U-Net architecture, our approach considerably improves the quality of the generated drum samples, and that the conditional input indeed shapes the perceptual characteristics of the sounds. Also, we provide audio examples and release the code used in our experiments.","['https://openalex.org/W2963971656', 'https://openalex.org/W2995233853', 'https://openalex.org/W2212660284', 'https://openalex.org/W2970006822', 'https://openalex.org/W3029579848', 'https://openalex.org/W2963857374', 'https://openalex.org/W3021164770', 'https://openalex.org/W3118215210', 'https://openalex.org/W2962760235', 'https://openalex.org/W2963373786', 'https://openalex.org/W2548275288', 'https://openalex.org/W2997367363', 'https://openalex.org/W2606176153', 'https://openalex.org/W2964243274', 'https://openalex.org/W2950299304', 'https://openalex.org/W2108598243', 'https://openalex.org/W2796010067', 'https://openalex.org/W2962919088', 'https://openalex.org/W3015287975', 'https://openalex.org/W1677182931', 'https://openalex.org/W2804722844', 'https://openalex.org/W1959608418', 'https://openalex.org/W2910577860', 'https://openalex.org/W2903005299', 'https://openalex.org/W2519091744', 'https://openalex.org/W2948211236', 'https://openalex.org/W2746457594', 'https://openalex.org/W2962879692', 'https://openalex.org/W2099471712', 'https://openalex.org/W2955263139', 'https://openalex.org/W2909561150', 'https://openalex.org/W2905488776', 'https://openalex.org/W2963889406', 'https://openalex.org/W2267126114', 'https://openalex.org/W2774848319']",2020-10-11

Successfully adapting generative machine learning to design engineering may enable such automated design synthesis and is a research subject of great importance. We present a review and analysis of deep generative machine learning models in engineering design. Deep generative models (DGMs) typically leverage deep networks to learn from an input dataset and synthesize new designs. Recently, DGMs such as feedforward neural networks (NNs), generative adversarial networks (GANs), variational autoencoders (VAEs), and certain deep reinforcement learning (DRL) frameworks have shown promising results in design applications like structural optimization, materials design, and shape synthesis. The prevalence of DGMs in engineering design has skyrocketed since 2016. Anticipating the continued growth, we conduct a review of recent advances to benefit researchers interested in DGMs for design. We structure our review as an exposition of the algorithms, datasets, representation methods, and applications commonly used in the current literature. In particular, we discuss key works that have introduced new techniques and methods in DGMs, successfully applied DGMs to a design-related domain, or directly supported the development of DGMs through datasets or auxiliary methods. We further identify key challenges and limitations currently seen in DGMs across design fields, such as design creativity, handling constraints and objectives, and modeling both form and functional performance simultaneously. In our discussion, we identify possible solution pathways as key areas on which to target the future work.","['https://openalex.org/W2108924389', 'https://openalex.org/W4205947740',

An important challenge in this field is to balance user control and autonomy in music generation systems. In this work, we present BassNet, a deep learning model for generating bass guitar tracks based on musical source material. An innovative aspect of our work is that the model is trained to learn a temporally stable two-dimensional latent space variable that offers interactive user control. We empirically show that the model can disentangle bass patterns that require sensitivity to harmony, instrument timbre, and rhythm. An ablation study reveals that this capability is because of the temporal stability constraint on latent space trajectories during training. We also demonstrate that models that are trained on pop/rock music learn a latent space that offers control over the diatonic characteristics of the output, among other things. Lastly, we present and discuss generated bass tracks for three different music fragments. The work that is presented here is a step toward the integration of AI-based technology in the workflow of musical content creators.","['https://openalex.org/W2137884954', 'https://openalex.org/W2020166869', 'https://openalex.org/W1819710477', 'https://openalex.org/W2186572712', 'https://openalex.org/W6929360442', 'https://openalex.org/W2560316200', 'https://openalex.org/W2169264582', 'https://openalex.org/W6681096077', 'https://openalex.org/W2007726935', 'https://openalex.org/W2141998831', 'https://openalex.org/W2120190345', 'https://openalex.org/W2136163184', 'https://openalex.org/W2997367363', 'https://openalex.org/W2809277943', 'https://openalex.org/W2146444479', 'https://openalex.org/W1999192586', 'https://openalex.org/W6647934165', 'https://openalex.org/W6605505536', 'https://openalex.org/W2774077477', 'https://openalex.org/W2963408210', 'https://openalex.org/W2283344589', 'https://openalex.org/W2619409124', 'https://openalex.org/W2772474126', 'https://openalex.org/W2884558435', 'https://openalex.org/W2919624000', 'https://openalex.org/W6758675244', 'https://openalex.org/W6755257315', 'https://openalex.org/W2606176153', 'https://openalex.org/W2792210438', 'https://openalex.org/W2956041762', 'https://openalex.org/W2998588915', 'https://openalex.org/W3081378361', 'https://openalex.org/W3015287975', 'https://openalex.org/W2782255520', 'https://openalex.org/W2901638613', 'https://openalex.org/W6912385387', 'https://openalex.org/W1972014290', 'https://openalex.org/W2741023222', 'https://openalex.org/W2160115902', 'https://openalex.org/W2033546134', 'https://openalex.org/W2009841905', 'https://openalex.org/W2138960858', 'https://openalex.org/W2076608692', 'https://openalex.org/W3081424945', 'https://openalex.org/W2962866891', 'https://openalex.org/W2405656250', 'https://openalex.org/W2962850830', 'https://openalex.org/W6687483927', 'https://openalex.org/W2968826970', 'https://openalex.org/W4285715698', 'https://openalex.org/W2952631504', 'https://openalex.org/W6631190155', 'https://openalex.org/W2619538244', 'https://openalex.org/W2746068898', 'https://openalex.org/W2997574889', 'https://openalex.org/W2951004968', 'https://openalex.org/W3021164770', 'https://openalex.org/W2584032004', 'https://openalex.org/W2579406683', 'https://openalex.org/W2151024047', 'https://openalex.org/W2951535099', 'https://openalex.org/W1989940876', 'https://openalex.org/W2949382160', 'https://openalex.org/W2963575853', 'https://openalex.org/W2805697608', 'https://openalex.org/W3029579848', 'https://openalex.org/W1977444015', 'https://openalex.org/W2788560150', 'https://openalex.org/W2145094598', 'https://openalex.org/W2910577860', 'https://openalex.org/W2958111171', 'https://openalex.org/W2931932963', 'https://openalex.org/W2966220025', 'https://openalex.org/W3104194627', 'https://openalex.org/W2950299304', 'https://openalex.org/W2724233922', 'https://openalex.org/W2963681776', 'https://openalex.org/W134527144']",2020-09-22
https://openalex.org/W3148695041,https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5624362,Symbolic Music Generation with Diffusion Models,"Score-based generative models and diffusion probabilistic models have been successful at generating high-quality samples in a variety of continuous domains. However, due to their Langevin-inspired sampling mechanisms, their application to discrete symbolic music data has been limited. In this work, we present a technique for training diffusion models on symbolic music data by parameterizing the discrete domain in the continuous latent space of a pre-trained variational autoencoder.

We develop a method for synthesizing a rap verse based on the content of any text (e.g., a news article), or for augmenting pre-existing rap lyrics. Our method, called Rapformer, is based on training a Transformer-based denoising autoencoder to reconstruct rap lyrics from content words extracted from the lyrics, trying to preserve the essential meaning, while matching the target style. Rapformer features a novel BERT-based paraphrasing scheme for rhyme enhancement which increases the average rhyme density of output lyrics by 10%. Experimental results on three diverse input domains show that Rapformer is capable of generating technically fluent verses that offer a good trade-off between content preservation and style transfer. Furthermore, a Turing-test-like experiment reveals that Rapformer fools human lyrics experts 25% of the time.","['https://openalex.org/W2964008635', 'https://openalex.org/W2964202925', 'https://openalex.org/W2785567863', 'https://openalex.org/W2081580037', 'https://openalex.org/W2949615363', 'https://openalex.org/W2963366196', 'https://openalex.org/W2963403868', 'https://openalex.org/W2799022285', 'https://openalex.org/W2798662960', 'https://openalex.org/W2785543907', 'https://openalex.org/W2994817889', 'https://openalex.org/W2998659916', 'https://openalex.org/W3104814493', 'https://openalex.org/W2949555952', 'https://openalex.org/W2946393904', 'https://openalex.org/W4386506836', 'https://openalex.org/W2250842199', 'https://openalex.org/W2963341956', 'https://openalex.org/W4288089799', 'https://openalex.org/W3102934792', 'https://openalex.org/W2530647954', 'https://openalex.org/W2997195635', 'https://openalex.org/W2798782765', 'https://openalex.org/W1510519407', 'https://openalex.org/W2605035112', 'https://openalex.org/W2965033324', 'https://openalex.org/W3021164770', 'https://openalex.org/W2101105183', 'https://openalex.org/W2160467647', 'https://openalex.org/W2741104967', 'https://openalex.org/W2970744242', 'https://openalex.org/W2914442349', 'https://openalex.org/W2981852735', 'https://openalex.org/W2962784628', 'https://openalex.org/W2963631950', 'https://openalex.org/W2617566453', 'https://openalex.org/W2990427715', 'https://openalex.org/W2982399380', 'https://openalex.org/W2996264288', 'https://openalex.org/W3034999214', 'https://openalex.org/W2949806279', 'https://openalex.org/W2768440179', 'https://openalex.org/W2053154970', 'https://openalex.org/W2573032371', 'https://openalex.org/W131896369', 'https://openalex.org/W4385245566', 'https://openalex.org/W2962768052', 'https://openalex.org/W3013167650', 'https://openalex.org/W622113263']",2020-01-01

However, CRISPR-Cas suffers from off-target effects — unintended genetic modifications in the genome that arise from its use. In this work, we present crispr2vec: a deep metric learning approach for embedding CRISPR single guide RNA (sgRNA) sequences and predicting off-target cuts. Given a fixed target sequence, we show that our learned embedding yields a faithful representation of potential off-targets. We present a new triplet sampling strategy specifically for CRISPR sequences that improves the quality of our embedding. We show the resulting embedding generalizes across different off-target cut detection assays. Finally, we demonstrate the superiority of our deep metric learning method in its ability to predict off-target cuts compared to previous literature in cross fold validation across different datasets for both seen and unseen sgRNAs.","['https://openalex.org/W2765610460', 'https://openalex.org/W2899948177', 'https://openalex.org/W1019830208', 'https://openalex.org/W2115603949', 'https://openalex.org/W3017334101', 'https://openalex.org/W2726053863', 'https://openalex.org/W2127749855', 'https://openalex.org/W2606377603', 'https://openalex.org/W2467139031', 'https://openalex.org/W2105464583', 'https://openalex.org/W2064815984', 'https://openalex.org/W2896457183', 'https://openalex.org/W2561754210', 'https://openalex.org/W2252568502', 'https://openalex.org/W2050480410', 'https://openalex.org/W1997281938', 'https://openalex.org/W2810756255', 'https://openalex.org/W2791311992', 'https://openalex.org/W2461013690', 'https://openalex.org/W2096261947', 'https://openalex.org/W2036176224', 'https://openalex.org/W2045435533', 'https://openalex.org/W3021896513', 'https://openalex.org/W2345512687', 'https://openalex.org/W2273244674', 'https://openalex.org/W2984059576', 'https://openalex.org/W2224398381', 'https://openalex.org/W2888908334', 'https://openalex.org/W2163605009', 'https://openalex.org/W2782551527', 'https://openalex.org/W2003171404', 'https://openalex.org/W2157205823', 'https://openalex.org/W1915704240', 'https://openalex.org/W2889664156', 'https://openalex.org/W2070614858', 'https://openalex.org/W1977709885', 'https://openalex.org/W2096733369', 'https://openalex.org/W1986316308', 'https://openalex.org/W2479945688', 'https://openalex.org/W2188223075', 'https://openalex.org/W1990149668', 'https://openalex.org/W2611661371', 'https://openalex.org/W2003797386', 'https://openalex.org/W2051255304', 'https://openalex.org/W2260024370', 'https://openalex.org/W2433743436', 'https://openalex.org/W2951760474', 'https://openalex.org/W2198606573', 'https://openalex.org/W2901218091', 'https://openalex.org/W2963341956', 'https://openalex.org/W2949382160', 'https://openalex.org/W3021164770', 'https://openalex.org/W3099206234', 'https://openalex.org/W2935703330', 'https://openalex.org/W2902781388', 'https://openalex.org/W2187089797', 'https://openalex.org/W2951054376']",2020-10-29

It enforces sequential layer updates, thus preventing efficient parallelization of the training process. Furthermore, its biological plausibility is being challenged. Alternative schemes have been devised; yet, under the constraint of synaptic asymmetry, none have scaled to modern deep learning tasks and architectures. Here, we challenge this perspective, and study the applicability of Direct Feedback Alignment to neural view synthesis, recommender systems, geometric learning, and natural language processing. In contrast with previous studies limited to computer vision tasks, our findings show that it successfully trains a large range of state-of-the-art deep learning architectures, with performance close to fine-tuned backpropagation.

Also, depending on the used upsampling layer, such artifacts can either be tonal (additive high-frequency noise) or filtering artifacts (substractive, attenuating some bands). We investigate the practical implications of having upsampling artifacts in the resulting audio, by studying how different artifacts interact and assessing their impact on the models' performance. To that end, we benchmark a large set of upsampling layers for music source separation: different transposed and sub-pixel convolution setups, different interpolation upsamplers (including two novel layers based on stretch and sinc interpolation), and different wavelet-based upsamplers (including a novel learnable wavelet layer). Our results show that filtering artifacts, associated with interpolation upsamplers, are perceptually preferrable, even if they tend to achieve worse objective scores.","['https://openalex.org/W6740873641', 'https://openalex.org/W2476548250', 'https://openalex.org/W2020919250', 'https://openalex.org/W6732646663', 'https://openalex.org/W2972443522', 'https://openalex.org/W6751512325', 'https://openalex.org/W6755257315', 'https://openalex.org/W6731370813', 'https://openalex.org/W2127851351', 'https://openalex.org/W6631190155', 'https://openalex.org/W6724804524', 'https://openalex.org/W6776218486', 'https://openalex.org/W3015724290', 'https://openalex.org/W2535388113', 'https://openalex.org/W3015197852', 'https://openalex.org/W6785363610', 'https://openalex.org/W6770315077', 'https://openalex.org/W6767111847', 'https://openalex.org/W2894295011', 'https://openalex.org/W3162366763', 'https://openalex.org/W2964121744', 'https://openalex.org/W584173323', 'https://openalex.org/W2502312327', 'https://openalex.org/W2970006822', 'https://openalex.org/W2567070169', 'https://openalex.org/W2990594533', 'https://openalex.org/W2580221632', 'https://openalex.org/W2963341071', 'https://openalex.org/W3021164770', 'https://openalex.org/W3046970875', 'https://openalex.org/W2963970792', 'https://openalex.org/W4287802874', 'https://openalex.org/W2734957715', 'https://openalex.org/W2669032454', 'https://openalex.org/W2963452667', 'https://openalex.org/W4297817572', 'https://openalex.org/W1522301498', 'https://openalex.org/W4298310324']",2023-09-04

We focus on user inputs that describe both ""what to play"" (via scores in MIDI format) and ""how to play it"" (via rhythmic inputs to specify expressive timing and dynamics). Through experiments, we demonstrate that our method can facilitate human-AI co-creation of drum loops with diverse and customizable outputs. In the process, we argue for the interaction paradigm of mapping by demonstration as a promising approach to working with deep learning models that are capable of generating complex and realistic musical parts.","['https://openalex.org/W6776218486', 'https://openalex.org/W2901601067', 'https://openalex.org/W2891794946', 'https://openalex.org/W6783970415', 'https://openalex.org/W2957258179', 'https://openalex.org/W6606416387', 'https://openalex.org/W6755406732', 'https://openalex.org/W2343635552', 'https://openalex.org/W2948574791', 'https://openalex.org/W2936858163', 'https://openalex.org/W6771763809', 'https://openalex.org/W6751598888', 'https://openalex.org/W3049637270', 'https://openalex.org/W3049174246', 'https://openalex.org/W2946521317', 'https://openalex.org/W2990617740', 'https://openalex.org/W3014498426', 'https://openalex.org/W3046218710', 'https://openalex.org/W6640963894', 'https://openalex.org/W6893759657', 'https://openalex.org/W6785120823', 'https://openalex.org/W3047453285', 'https://openalex.org/W2132184901', 'https://openalex.org/W2161012827', 'https://openalex.org/W2059322641', 'https://openalex.org/W6712232353', 'https://openalex.org/W2115083233', 'https://openalex.org/W2982125965', 'https://openalex.org/W2772692325', 'https://openalex.org/W2792210438', 'https://openalex.org/W4287643030', 'https://openalex.org/W3021164770', 'https://openalex.org/W2805697608', 'https://openalex.org/W3092135915', 'https://openalex.org/W2982647297', 'https://openalex.org/W3000389243', 'https://openalex.org/W2396281659', 'https://openalex.org/W2995233853', 'https://openalex.org/W2169264582', 'https://openalex.org/W1959608418', 'https://openalex.org/W3154171150', 'https://openalex.org/W2962930338', 'https://openalex.org/W2991178431', 'https://openalex.org/W3098518646', 'https://openalex.org/W3112895167', 'https://openalex.org/W4288366059', 'https://openalex.org/W2962699318', 'https://openalex.org/W3111037961', 'https://openalex.org/W4287802874']",2021-07-19

GuitarPro has established itself as a widely used tablature format and software enabling musicians to edit and share songs for musical practice, learning, and composition. In this work, we present DadaGP, a new symbolic music dataset comprising 26,181 song scores in the GuitarPro format covering 739 musical genres, along with an accompanying tokenized format well-suited for generative sequence models such as the Transformer. The tokenized format is inspired by event-based MIDI encodings, often used in symbolic music generation models. The dataset is released with an encoder/decoder which converts GuitarPro files to tokens and back. We present results of a use case in which DadaGP is used to train a Transformer-based model to generate new songs in GuitarPro format. We discuss other relevant use cases for the dataset (guitar-bass transcription, music style transfer and artist/genre classification) as well as ethical implications. DadaGP opens up the possibility to train GuitarPro score generators, fine-tune models on custom data, create new styles of music, AI-powered song-writing apps, and human-AI improvisation.","['https://openalex.org/W3021164770', 'https://openalex.org/W2909703423', 'https://openalex.org/W3183357160', 'https://openalex.org/W1986975415', 'https://openalex.org/W2613740626', 'https://openalex.org/W3080857286', 'https://openalex.org/W2404407838', 'https://openalex.org/W2902076983', 'https://openalex.org/W2964706117', 'https://openalex.org/W2891757161', 'https://openalex.org/W2940744433', 'https://openalex.org/W2737347211', 'https://openalex.org/W3187060660', 'https://openalex.org/W2898148140', 'https://openalex.org/W2964110616', 'https://openalex.org/W3147925821', 'https://openalex.org/W2998490864', 'https://openalex.org/W3034559727', 'https://openalex.org/W2962941684', 'https://openalex.org/W2958623036', 'https://openalex.org/W2129192849', 'https://openalex.org/W3049247973', 'https://openalex.org/W2394782790', 'https://openalex.org/W2261080303', 'https://openalex.org/W2963494889', 'https://openalex.org/W2574842964', 'https://openalex.org/W3092879656', 'https://openalex.org/W2296230291', 'https://openalex.org/W3183478142', 'https://openalex.org/W3175663427', 'https://openalex.org/W2963403868', 'https://openalex.org/W2919624000', 'https://openalex.org/W3163784447', 'https://openalex.org/W2377006970', 'https://openalex.org/W3093121331', 'https://openalex.org/W2921495374', 'https://openalex.org/W3185497054', 'https://openalex.org/W2741766967', 'https://openalex.org/W2991248973', 'https://openalex.org/W2990716218']",2021-11-07

However, making them operable with semantically meaningful controls remains an open challenge. An obvious approach is to control the GAN by conditioning it on metadata contained in audio datasets. Unfortunately, audio datasets often lack the desired annotations, especially in the musical domain. A way to circumvent this lack of annotations is to generate them, for example, with an automatic audio-tagging system. The output probabilities of such systems (so-called ""soft labels"") carry rich information about the characteristics of the respective audios and can be used to distill the knowledge from a teacher model into a student model. In this work, we perform knowledge distillation from a large audio tagging system into an adversarial audio synthesizer that we call DarkGAN. Results show that DarkGAN can synthesize musical audio with acceptable quality and exhibits moderate attribute control even with out-of-distribution input conditioning. We release the code and provide audio examples on the accompanying website.","['https://openalex.org/W2948211236', 'https://openalex.org/W2962760235', 'https://openalex.org/W2962919088', 'https://openalex.org/W2774848319', 'https://openalex.org/W2750384547', 'https://openalex.org/W2593116425', 'https://openalex.org/W3137586311', 'https://openalex.org/W3015780049', 'https://openalex.org/W3094550259', 'https://openalex.org/W2910577860', 'https://openalex.org/W3109547540', 'https://openalex.org/W3127854286', 'https://openalex.org/W2987809065', 'https://openalex.org/W3034431451', 'https://openalex.org/W2962756039', 'https://openalex.org/W2108598243', 'https://openalex.org/W2099471712', 'https://openalex.org/W2746457594', 'https://openalex.org/W2963726581', 'https://openalex.org/W2962974533', 'https://openalex.org/W2950299304', 'https://openalex.org/W2804722844', 'https://openalex.org/W2680270903', 'https://openalex.org/W2294370754', 'https://openalex.org/W3136272958', 'https://openalex.org/W3029579848', 'https://openalex.org/W3118215210', 'https://openalex.org/W2561196672', 'https://openalex.org/W2796010067', 'https://openalex.org/W2532781556', 'https://openalex.org/W2955263139', 'https://openalex.org/W2962879692', 'https://openalex.org/W3015338123', 'https://openalex.org/W3021164770', 'https://openalex.org/W3098403858', 'https://openalex.org/W1959608418', 'https://openalex.org/W2963889406', 'https://openalex.org/W2963927126', 'https://openalex.org/W2903005299', 'https://openalex.org/W2905488776', 'https://openalex.org/W2963402808', 'https://openalex.org/W2996286887', 'https://openalex.org/W2893749619', 'https://openalex.org/W1602122992', 'https://openalex.org/W3034526383', 'https://openalex.org/W2519091744', 'https://openalex.org/W2548275288', 'https://openalex.org/W3035574324', 'https://openalex.org/W2134797427', 'https://openalex.org/W2963971656', 'https://openalex.org/W2970006822', 'https://openalex.org/W2963373786', 'https://openalex.org/W2606176153', 'https://openalex.org/W1821462560']",2021-11-07

Being bound to local convolutions, CNNs need explicit 3D biases to model geometric transformations. In contrast, we demonstrate that a transformer-based model can synthesize entirely novel views without any hand-engineered 3D biases. This is achieved by (i) a global attention mechanism for implicitly learning long-range 3D correspondences between source and target views, and (ii) a probabilistic formulation necessary to capture the ambiguity inherent in predicting novel views from a single image, thereby overcoming the limitations of previous approaches that are restricted to relatively small viewpoint changes. We evaluate various ways to integrate 3D priors into a transformer architecture. However, our experiments show that no such geometric priors are required and that the transformer is capable of implicitly learning 3D relationships between images. Furthermore, this approach outperforms the state of the art in terms of visual quality while covering the full distribution of possible realizations.

This restricted form of supervision limits their generality and usability since additional labeled data is needed to specify any other visual concept. Learning directly from raw text about images is a promising alternative which leverages a much broader source of supervision. We demonstrate that the simple pre-training task of predicting which caption goes with which image is an efficient and scalable way to learn SOTA image representations from scratch on a dataset of 400 million (image, text) pairs collected from the internet. After pre-training, natural language is used to reference learned visual concepts (or describe new ones) enabling zero-shot transfer of the model to downstream tasks. We study the performance of this approach by benchmarking on over 30 different existing computer vision datasets, spanning tasks such as OCR, action recognition in videos, geo-localization, and many types of fine-grained object classification. The model transfers non-trivially to most tasks and is often competitive with a fully supervised baseline without the need for any dataset specific training.

We achieve this on unconditional image synthesis by finding a better architecture through a series of ablations. For conditional image synthesis, we further improve sample quality with classifier guidance: a simple, compute-efficient method for trading off diversity for fidelity using gradients from a classifier. We achieve an FID of 2.97 on ImageNet 128$\times$128, 4.59 on ImageNet 256$\times$256, and 7.72 on ImageNet 512$\times$512, and we match BigGAN-deep even with as few as 25 forward passes per sample, all while maintaining better coverage of the distribution. Finally, we find that classifier guidance combines well with upsampling diffusion models, further improving FID to 3.94 on ImageNet 256$\times$256 and 3.85 on ImageNet 512$\times$512.

https://openalex.org/W3095645723,https://doi.org/10.48550/arxiv.2010.14701,Scaling Laws for Autoregressive Generative Modeling,"We identify empirical scaling laws for the cross-entropy loss in four domains: generative image modeling, video modeling, multimodal image$\leftrightarrow$text models, and mathematical problem solving. In all cases autoregressive Transformers smoothly improve in performance as model size and compute budgets increase, following a power-law plus constant scaling law. The optimal model size also depends on the compute budget through a power-law, with exponents that are nearly universal across all data domains. The cross-entropy loss has an information theoretic interpretation as $S($True$) + D_{\mathrm{KL}}($True$||$Model$)$, and the empirical scaling laws suggest a prediction for both the true data distribution's entropy and the KL divergence between the true and model distributions. With this interpretation, billion-parameter Transformers are nearly perfect models of the YFCC100M image distribution downsampled to an $8\times 8$ resolution, and we can forecast the model size needed to achieve any given reducible loss (ie $D_{\mathrm{KL}}$) in nats/image for other resolutions. We find a number of additional scaling laws in specific domains: (a) we identify a scaling relation for the mutual information between captions and images in multimodal models, and show how to answer the question ""Is a picture worth a thousand words?""; (b) in the case of mathematical problem solving, we identify scaling laws for model performance when extrapolating beyond the training distribution; (c) we finetune generative image models for ImageNet classification and find smooth scaling of the classification loss and error rate, even as the generative loss levels off. Taken together, these results strengthen the case that scaling laws have important implications for neural network performance, including on downstream tasks.","['https://openalex.org/W2741430497', 'https://openalex.org/W3009686669', 'https://openalex.org/W3021164770', 'https://openalex.org/W3023786569', 'https://openalex.org/W1544092585', 'https://openalex.org/W2768282280', 'https://openalex.org/W2963799213', 'https://openalex.org/W2940744433', 'https://openalex.org/W2912007050', 'https://openalex.org/W2952060378', 'https://openalex.org/W2903697572', 'https://openalex.org/W3022131108', 'https://openalex.org/W3001279689', 'https://openalex.org/W2994760783', 'https://openalex.org/W3019142305', 'https://openalex.org/W3034340181', 'https://openalex.org/W2970217468', 'https://openalex.org/W2776610675', 'https://openalex.org/W2809090039', 'https://openalex.org/W2981037730', 'https://openalex.org/W2996151541', 'https://openalex.org/W2787214294', 'https://openalex.org/W3036991069']",2020-10-28

VideoGPT uses VQ-VAE that learns downsampled discrete latent representations of a raw video by employing 3D convolutions and axial self-attention. A simple GPT-like architecture is then used to autoregressively model the discrete latents using spatio-temporal position encodings. Despite the simplicity in formulation and ease of training, our architecture is able to generate samples competitive with state-of-the-art GAN models for video generation on the BAIR Robot dataset, and generate high fidelity natural videos from UCF-101 and Tumbler GIF Dataset (TGIF). We hope our proposed architecture serves as a reproducible reference for a minimalistic implementation of transformer based video generation models.

Especially music, the topic of this paper, has attracted widespread attention of countless researchers.The whole process of producing music can be divided into three stages, corresponding to the three levels of music generation: score generation produces scores, performance generation adds performance characteristics to the scores, and audio generation converts scores with performance characteristics into audio by assigning timbre or generates music in audio format directly. Previous surveys have explored the network models employed in the field of automatic music generation. However, the development history, the model evolution, as well as the pros and cons of same music generation task have not been clearly illustrated. This paper attempts to provide an overview of various composition tasks under different music generation levels, covering most of the currently popular music generation tasks using deep learning. In addition, we summarize the datasets suitable for diverse tasks, discuss the music representations, the evaluation methods as well as the challenges under different levels, and finally point out several future directions.","['https://openalex.org/W2153579005', 'https://openalex.org/W2997586082', 'https://openalex.org/W1586966408', 'https://openalex.org/W3102568015',

https://openalex.org/W3196163807,https://doi.org/10.48550/arxiv.2108.08827,ImageBART: Bidirectional Context with Multinomial Diffusion for Autoregressive Image Synthesis,"Autoregressive models and their sequential factorization of the data likelihood have recently demonstrated great potential for image representation and synthesis. Nevertheless, they incorporate image context in a linear 1D order by attending only to previously synthesized image patches above or to the left. Not only is this unidirectional, sequential bias of attention unnatural for images as it disregards large parts of a scene until synthesis is almost complete. It also processes the entire image on a single scale, thus ignoring more global contextual information up to the gist of the entire scene. As a remedy we incorporate a coarse-to-fine hierarchy of context by combining the autoregressive formulation with a multinomial diffusion process: Whereas a multistage diffusion process successively removes information to coarsen an image, we train a (short) Markov chain to invert this process. In each stage, the resulting autoregressive ImageBART model progressively incorporates context from previous stages in a coarse-to-fine manner. Experiments show greatly improved image modification capabilities over autoregressive models while also providing high-fidelity image generation, both of which are enabled through efficient training in a compressed latent space. Specifically, our approach can take unrestricted, user-provided masks into account to perform local image editing. Thus, in contrast to pure autoregressive models, it can solve free-form image inpainting and, in the case of conditional models, local, text-guided image modification without requiring mask-specific training.","['https://openalex.org/W2475287302', 'https://openalex.org/W3118608800', 'https://openalex.org/W2129069237', 'https://openalex.org/W3162926177', 'https://openalex.org/W1959608418', 'https://openalex.org/W2962785568', 'https://openalex.org/W3180355996', 'https://openalex.org/W2559823555', 'https://openalex.org/W2962820504', 'https://openalex.org/W2922386270', 'https://openalex.org/W2962990490', 'https://openalex.org/W2005308357', 'https://openalex.org/W648786980', 'https://openalex.org/W2962897886', 'https://openalex.org/W3098903812', 'https://openalex.org/W2963636093', 'https://openalex.org/W2798434327', 'https://openalex.org/W3034445277', 'https://openalex.org/W2108598243', 'https://openalex.org/W2963135265', 'https://openalex.org/W3135367836', 'https://openalex.org/W1710476689', 'https://openalex.org/W2963403868', 'https://openalex.org/W3098510582', 'https://openalex.org/W3152733922', 'https://openalex.org/W2893749619', 'https://openalex.org/W2560512785', 'https://openalex.org/W2962770929', 'https://openalex.org/W3121345697', 'https://openalex.org/W2963799213', 'https://openalex.org/W2964122153', 'https://openalex.org/W967544008', 'https://openalex.org/W2971034910', 'https://openalex.org/W3021164770', 'https://openalex.org/W2962985516', 'https://openalex.org/W3103781353', 'https://openalex.org/W3120243996', 'https://openalex.org/W2572816092', 'https://openalex.org/W2542835211', 'https://openalex.org/W3100572490', 'https://openalex.org/W3150134882', 'https://openalex.org/W2963373786', 'https://openalex.org/W3099188186', 'https://openalex.org/W2962859665', 'https://openalex.org/W2903739847', 'https://openalex.org/W3035574324', 'https://openalex.org/W3034776267', 'https://openalex.org/W2949416428', 'https://openalex.org/W2970014727', 'https://openalex.org/W2963292439', 'https://openalex.org/W2985308740', 'https://openalex.org/W3135058862', 'https://openalex.org/W1866230956', 'https://openalex.org/W3129576130', 'https://openalex.org/W2331128040', 'https://openalex.org/W3119997354', 'https://openalex.org/W2906083776', 'https://openalex.org/W3122887982', 'https://openalex.org/W2962974533', 'https://openalex.org/W3112993007', 'https://openalex.org/W2963981733', 'https://openalex.org/W2963248296', 'https://openalex.org/W2963341956', 'https://openalex.org/W2522389179', 'https://openalex.org/W2963174698', 'https://openalex.org/W3128876955', 'https://openalex.org/W3159647175', 'https://openalex.org/W2963586005']",2021-08-19

In this paper, we present ATISS, a novel autoregressive transformer architecture for creating diverse and plausible synthetic indoor environments, given only the room type and its floor plan. In contrast to prior work, which poses scene synthesis as sequence generation, our model generates rooms as unordered sets of objects. We argue that this formulation is more natural, as it makes ATISS generally useful beyond fully automatic room layout synthesis. For example, the same trained model can be used in interactive applications for general scene completion, partial room re-arrangement with any objects specified by the user, as well as object suggestions for any partial room. To enable this, our model leverages the permutation equivariance of the transformer when conditioning on the partial scene, and is trained to be permutation-invariant across object orderings. Our model is trained end-to-end as an autoregressive generative model using only labeled 3D bounding boxes as supervision. Evaluations on four room types in the 3D-FRONT dataset demonstrate that our model consistently generates plausible room layouts that are more realistic than existing methods. In addition, it has fewer parameters, is simpler to implement and train and runs up to 8 times faster than existing methods.","['https://openalex.org/W2557269700', 'https://openalex.org/W3112776202', 'https://openalex.org/W2060268527', 'https://openalex.org/W3201922548', 'https://openalex.org/W2981010689', 'https://openalex.org/W3132535424', 'https://openalex.org/W2103815986', 'https://openalex.org/W3034573343', 'https://openalex.org/W2964122153', 'https://openalex.org/W2419448466', 'https://openalex.org/W2893749619', 'https://openalex.org/W2250673545', 'https://openalex.org/W2985936292', 'https://openalex.org/W3137120824', 'https://openalex.org/W3153854932', 'https://openalex.org/W3035574324', 'https://openalex.org/W2940744433', 'https://openalex.org/W3202579984', 'https://openalex.org/W3040538742', 'https://openalex.org/W2963807318', 'https://openalex.org/W3034445277', 'https://openalex.org/W2953273646', 'https://openalex.org/W2962695743', 'https://openalex.org/W3035046407', 'https://openalex.org/W3000176874', 'https://openalex.org/W2963341956', 'https://openalex.org/W2519091744', 'https://openalex.org/W2902539442', 'https://openalex.org/W2990222759', 'https://openalex.org/W2149846167', 'https://openalex.org/W3098903812', 'https://openalex.org/W2980088508', 'https://openalex.org/W2163605009', 'https://openalex.org/W2009188425', 'https://openalex.org/W2099471712', 'https://openalex.org/W3119786062', 'https://openalex.org/W3035108870', 'https://openalex.org/W2798622261', 'https://openalex.org/W2962770929', 'https://openalex.org/W2770875015', 'https://openalex.org/W2963767194', 'https://openalex.org/W2099854727', 'https://openalex.org/W3168314764', 'https://openalex.org/W3088333848', 'https://openalex.org/W2130634053', 'https://openalex.org/W2964121744', 'https://openalex.org/W2989341556', 'https://openalex.org/W2963403868', 'https://openalex.org/W2968638474', 'https://openalex.org/W3110015970', 'https://openalex.org/W2117741646', 'https://openalex.org/W2963981733', 'https://openalex.org/W3003555839', 'https://openalex.org/W2117088012', 'https://openalex.org/W2963676163', 'https://openalex.org/W2964334375', 'https://openalex.org/W3034600949', 'https://openalex.org/W2162559028', 'https://openalex.org/W2963139417', 'https://openalex.org/W2108598243', 'https://openalex.org/W3021164770', 'https://openalex.org/W2194775991', 'https://openalex.org/W3047258236', 'https://openalex.org/W3180355996', 'https://openalex.org/W3016025127', 'https://openalex.org/W3087067522', 'https://openalex.org/W3180251767', 'https://openalex.org/W3095066959', 'https://openalex.org/W1959608418', 'https://openalex.org/W2557465155', 'https://openalex.org/W3034727889', 'https://openalex.org/W2963925437', 'https://openalex.org/W3096609285', 'https://openalex.org/W2963601843', 'https://openalex.org/W2065745355', 'https://openalex.org/W2960202457', 'https://openalex.org/W3116489684', 'https://openalex.org/W2810181048']",2021-10-07

However, training VAEs often requires considerable hyperparameter tuning to determine the optimal amount of information retained by the latent variable. We study the impact of calibrated decoders, which learn the uncertainty of the decoding distribution and can determine this amount of information automatically, on the VAE performance. While many methods for learning calibrated decoders have been proposed, many of the recent papers that employ VAEs rely on heuristic hyperparameters and ad-hoc modifications instead. We perform the first comprehensive comparative analysis of calibrated decoder and provide recommendations for simple and effective VAE training. Our analysis covers a range of image and video datasets and several single-image and sequential VAE models. We further propose a simple but novel modification to the commonly used Gaussian decoder, which computes the prediction variance analytically. We observe empirically that using heuristic modifications is not necessary with our method.

We show that in expectation, the squared norm of the objective gradient averaged over the trajectory has an upper-bound which is explicit in the constants of the problem, parameters of the optimizer, the dimension $d$, and the total number of iterations $N$. This bound can be made arbitrarily small, and with the right hyper-parameters, Adam can be shown to converge with the same rate of convergence $O(d\ln(N)/\sqrt{N})$. When used with the default parameters, Adam doesn't converge, however, and just like constant step-size SGD, it moves away from the initialization point faster than Adagrad, which might explain its practical success. Finally, we obtain the tightest dependency on the heavy ball momentum decay rate $β_1$ among all previous convergence bounds for non-convex Adam and Adagrad, improving from $O((1-β_1)^{-3})$ to $O((1-β_1)^{-1})$.","['https://openalex.org/W1518461880', 'https://openalex.org/W2947578309', 'https://openalex.org/W2963698657', 'https://openalex.org/W2337540838', 'https://openalex.org/W2886463271', 'https://openalex.org/W2146502635', 'https://openalex.org/W2945414017', 'https://openalex.org/W2963613486', 'https://openalex.org/W2785523195', 'https://openalex.org/W2963450615', 'https://openalex.org/W2757196798', 'https://openalex.org/W3021164770', 'https://openalex.org/W2963208657', 'https://openalex.org/W2963341956', 'https://openalex.org/W2946511237', 'https://openalex.org/W2963563140', 'https://openalex.org/W2106709023', 'https://openalex.org/W1988720110']",2020-03-05

The theory is closely related to the Bayesian brain framework and, over the last two decades, has gained substantial influence in the fields of theoretical and cognitive neuroscience. A large body of research has arisen based on both empirically testing improved and extended theoretical and mathematical models of predictive coding, as well as in evaluating their potential biological plausibility for implementation in the brain and the concrete neurophysiological and psychological predictions made by the theory. Despite this enduring popularity, however, no comprehensive review of predictive coding theory, and especially of recent developments in this field, exists. Here, we provide a comprehensive review both of the core mathematical structure and logic of predictive coding, thus complementing recent tutorials in the literature. We also review a wide range of classic and recent work within the framework, ranging from the neurobiologically realistic microcircuits that could implement predictive coding, to the close relationship between predictive coding and the widely-used backpropagation of error algorithm, as well as surveying the close relationships between predictive coding and modern machine learning

https://openalex.org/W3039049049,https://doi.org/10.48550/arxiv.2007.00800,A Survey on Self-supervised Pre-training for Sequential Transfer Learning in Neural Networks,"Deep neural networks are typically trained under a supervised learning framework where a model learns a single task using labeled data. Instead of relying solely on labeled data, practitioners can harness unlabeled or related data to improve model performance, which is often more accessible and ubiquitous. Self-supervised pre-training for transfer learning is becoming an increasingly popular technique to improve state-of-the-art results using unlabeled data. It involves first pre-training a model on a large amount of unlabeled data, then adapting the model to target tasks of interest. In this review, we survey self-supervised learning methods and their applications within the sequential transfer learning framework. We provide an overview of the taxonomy for self-supervised learning and transfer learning, and highlight some prominent methods for designing pre-training tasks across different domains. Finally, we discuss recent trends and suggest areas for future investigation.","['https://openalex.org/W2125999363', 'https://openalex.org/W2963403868', 'https://openalex.org/W2604763608', 'https://openalex.org/W2963351454', 'https://openalex.org/W3015146382', 'https://openalex.org/W2963799213', 'https://openalex.org/W2170973209', 'https://openalex.org/W2147152072', 'https://openalex.org/W2792210438', 'https://openalex.org/W2798991696', 'https://openalex.org/W2116435618', 'https://openalex.org/W2146444479', 'https://openalex.org/W2963310665', 'https://openalex.org/W2105464873', 'https://openalex.org/W3090449556', 'https://openalex.org/W2165698076', 'https://openalex.org/W2516255829', 'https://openalex.org/W2089468765', 'https://openalex.org/W3013571468', 'https://openalex.org/W2969728147', 'https://openalex.org/W3021164770', 'https://openalex.org/W3082274269', 'https://openalex.org/W2575671312', 'https://openalex.org/W2979736514', 'https://openalex.org/W2963826423', 'https://openalex.org/W1614298861', 'https://openalex.org/W2064675550', 'https://openalex.org/W2326925005', 'https://openalex.org/W2138857742', 'https://openalex.org/W1748744376', 'https://openalex.org/W2487442924', 'https://openalex.org/W2949117887', 'https://openalex.org/W2099471712', 'https://openalex.org/W2996383576', 'https://openalex.org/W2972867623', 'https://openalex.org/W2919115771', 'https://openalex.org/W3171229070', 'https://openalex.org/W2753709519', 'https://openalex.org/W2952468927', 'https://openalex.org/W2619697695', 'https://openalex.org/W2110798204', 'https://openalex.org/W3035524453', 'https://openalex.org/W2015140204', 'https://openalex.org/W2412320034', 'https://openalex.org/W3006924828', 'https://openalex.org/W2025768430', 'https://openalex.org/W2963813662', 'https://openalex.org/W2963341956', 'https://openalex.org/W3025035610', 'https://openalex.org/W2995480165', 'https://openalex.org/W3007373432', 'https://openalex.org/W2951873722', 'https://openalex.org/W3024171804', 'https://openalex.org/W2755926663', 'https://openalex.org/W2980360762', 'https://openalex.org/W2965373594', 'https://openalex.org/W2108384452', 'https://openalex.org/W3104240813', 'https://openalex.org/W2624871570', 'https://openalex.org/W2842511635', 'https://openalex.org/W3034999214', 'https://openalex.org/W2108665656', 'https://openalex.org/W2962728572', 'https://openalex.org/W2950726992', 'https://openalex.org/W2944828972', 'https://openalex.org/W343636949', 'https://openalex.org/W2963420272', 'https://openalex.org/W2913340405', 'https://openalex.org/W2157364932', 'https://openalex.org/W3010874390', 'https://openalex.org/W1665214252', 'https://openalex.org/W2786808285', 'https://openalex.org/W2911779594', 'https://openalex.org/W2963114873', 'https://openalex.org/W1853900790', 'https://openalex.org/W2123421115', 'https://openalex.org/W2153579005', 'https://openalex.org/W2964212578', 'https://openalex.org/W2145680191', 'https://openalex.org/W830076066', 'https://openalex.org/W1970958875', 'https://openalex.org/W2938830017', 'https://openalex.org/W3010768098', 'https://openalex.org/W1959608418', 'https://openalex.org/W2980895577', 'https://openalex.org/W2042492924', 'https://openalex.org/W2599837529', 'https://openalex.org/W2788388592', 'https://openalex.org/W3034942609', 'https://openalex.org/W3011411500', 'https://openalex.org/W2119717200', 'https://openalex.org/W3030163527', 'https://openalex.org/W2975501350', 'https://openalex.org/W2108496475', 'https://openalex.org/W3034429116', 'https://openalex.org/W3034340181', 'https://openalex.org/W3033638351', 'https://openalex.org/W2163922914', 'https://openalex.org/W2136922672', 'https://openalex.org/W2948433173', 'https://openalex.org/W3005680577', 'https://openalex.org/W2973049979', 'https://openalex.org/W2963756346', 'https://openalex.org/W2970597249', 'https://openalex.org/W2308529009', 'https://openalex.org/W2558661413', 'https://openalex.org/W2963854351', 'https://openalex.org/W2138621090', 'https://openalex.org/W2470220343', 'https://openalex.org/W2613634265', 'https://openalex.org/W2959020461', 'https://openalex.org/W2970119519', 'https://openalex.org/W2100495367', 'https://openalex.org/W2321533354']",2020-07-01
https://openalex.org/W3136991969,https://doi.org/10.48550/arxiv.2103.12157,Tiny Transformers for Environmental Sound Classification at the Edge,"With the growth of the Internet of Things and the rise of Big Data, data processing and machine learning applications are being moved to cheap and low size, weight, and power (SWaP) devices at the edge, often in the form of mobile phones, embedded systems, or microcontrollers. The field of Cyber-Physical Measurements and Signature Intelligence (MASINT) makes use of these devices to analyze and exploit data in ways not otherwise possible, which results in increased data quality, increased security, and decreased bandwidth. However, methods to train and deploy models at the edge are limited, and models with sufficient accuracy are often too large for the edge device. Therefore, there is a clear need for techniques to create efficient AI/ML at the edge. This work presents training techniques for audio models in the field of environmental sound classification at the edge. Specifically, we design and train Transformers to classify office sounds in audio clips. Results show that a BERT-based Transformer, trained on Mel spectrograms, can outperform a CNN using 99.85% fewer parameters. To achieve this result, we first tested several audio feature extraction techniques designed for Transformers, using ESC-50 for evaluation, along with various augmentations. Our final model outperforms the state-of-the-art MFCC-based CNN on the office sounds dataset, using just over 6,000 parameters -- small enough to run on a microcontroller.","['https://openalex.org/W2593451766', 'https://openalex.org/W2972247414', 'https://openalex.org/W2949117887', 'https://openalex.org/W2962910554', 'https://openalex.org/W2529337537', 'https://openalex.org/W1997527178', 'https://openalex.org/W2751841560', 'https://openalex.org/W3046125265', 'https://openalex.org/W3082878506', 'https://openalex.org/W2963341956', 'https://openalex.org/W2525778437', 'https://openalex.org/W1972567154', 'https://openalex.org/W2914312680', 'https://openalex.org/W2975429091', 'https://openalex.org/W3030163527', 'https://openalex.org/W2970597249', 'https://openalex.org/W2996428491', 'https://openalex.org/W3016195076', 'https://openalex.org/W2963799213', 'https://openalex.org/W2978017171', 'https://openalex.org/W2943493972', 'https://openalex.org/W2768083292', 'https://openalex.org/W2795138957', 'https://openalex.org/W2963403868', 'https://openalex.org/W2981852735', 'https://openalex.org/W3045733172', 'https://openalex.org/W3035623224', 'https://openalex.org/W3021164770', 'https://openalex.org/W2038484192', 'https://openalex.org/W1979594949', 'https://openalex.org/W2909327627', 'https://openalex.org/W3098357269', 'https://openalex.org/W3046727238', 'https://openalex.org/W2676925568', 'https://openalex.org/W3094175596', 'https://openalex.org/W3034445277', 'https://openalex.org/W2963838685', 'https://openalex.org/W2969515962', 'https://openalex.org/W2949382160', 'https://openalex.org/W3043803126', 'https://openalex.org/W3027588817', 'https://openalex.org/W2766087987', 'https://openalex.org/W2593116425', 'https://openalex.org/W1996160964', 'https://openalex.org/W3094502228', 'https://openalex.org/W3095348033', 'https://openalex.org/W2052666245', 'https://openalex.org/W2766397045', 'https://openalex.org/W2008415856', 'https://openalex.org/W2313745396', 'https://openalex.org/W3044604993']",2021-03-22
https://openalex.org/W3168452307,https://doi.org/10.48550/arxiv.2106.05931,Score-based Generative Modeling in Latent Space,"Score-based generative models (SGMs) have recently demonstrated impressive results in terms of both sample quality and distribution coverage. However, they are usually applied directly in data space and often require thousands of network evaluations for sampling. Here, we propose the Latent Score-based Generative Model (LSGM), a novel approach that trains SGMs in a latent space, relying on the variational autoencoder framework. Moving from data to latent space allows us to train more expressive generative models, apply SGMs to non-continuous data, and learn smoother SGMs in a smaller space, resulting in fewer network evaluations and faster sampling. To enable training LSGMs end-to-end in a scalable and stable manner, we (i) introduce a new score-matching objective suitable to the LSGM setting, (ii) propose a novel parameterization of the score function that allows SGM to focus on the mismatch of the target distribution with respect to a simple Normal one, and (iii) analytically derive multiple techniques for variance reduction of the training objective. LSGM obtains a state-of-the-art FID score of 2.10 on CIFAR-10, outperforming all existing generative results on this dataset.

https://openalex.org/W3086298921,https://doi.org/10.48550/arxiv.2009.05359,Activation Relaxation: A Local Dynamical Approximation to Backpropagation in the Brain,"The backpropagation of error algorithm (backprop) has been instrumental in the recent success of deep learning. However, a key question remains as to whether backprop can be formulated in a manner suitable for implementation in neural circuitry. The primary challenge is to ensure that any candidate formulation uses only local information, rather than relying on global signals as in standard backprop. Recently several algorithms for approximating backprop using only local signals have been proposed. However, these algorithms typically impose other requirements which challenge biological plausibility: for example, requiring complex and precise connectivity schemes, or multiple sequential backwards phases with information being stored across phases. Here, we propose a novel algorithm, Activation Relaxation (AR), which is motivated by constructing the backpropagation gradient as the equilibrium point of a dynamical system. Our algorithm converges rapidly and robustly to the correct backpropagation gradients, requires only a single type of computational unit, utilises only a single parallel backwards relaxation phase, and can operate on arbitrary computation graphs. We illustrate these properties by training deep neural networks on visual classification tasks, and describe simplifications to the algorithm which remove further obstacles to neurobiological implementation (for example, the weight-transport problem, and the use of nonlinear derivatives), while preserving performance.","['https://openalex.org/W3008716087', 'https://openalex.org/W2552737632', 'https://openalex.org/W2989815357', 'https://openalex.org/W3160026928', 'https://openalex.org/W3030163527', 'https://openalex.org/W3001063045', 'https://openalex.org/W3033108376', 'https://openalex.org/W3118210634', 'https://openalex.org/W3021164770', 'https://openalex.org/W2099471712', 'https://openalex.org/W2062967916', 'https://openalex.org/W2789634097', 'https://openalex.org/W2626778328', 'https://openalex.org/W2131352719', 'https://openalex.org/W2750384547', 'https://openalex.org/W3001279689', 'https://openalex.org/W2006814548', 'https://openalex.org/W2128123567', 'https://openalex.org/W2131045394', 'https://openalex.org/W2787849668', 'https://openalex.org/W2842511635', 'https://openalex.org/W2027968420', 'https://openalex.org/W2935958002', 'https://openalex.org/W2964122153', 'https://openalex.org/W2578935686', 'https://openalex.org/W2766447205', 'https://openalex.org/W2949382160', 'https://openalex.org/W2527798464', 'https://openalex.org/W2194775991', 'https://openalex.org/W2078529082', 'https://openalex.org/W2064675550', 'https://openalex.org/W2040036684', 'https://openalex.org/W2771247232', 'https://openalex.org/W3037315641', 'https://openalex.org/W3091211810', 'https://openalex.org/W2173520492', 'https://openalex.org/W2109059823', 'https://openalex.org/W2003357516', 'https://openalex.org/W1855112655', 'https://openalex.org/W2127389037', 'https://openalex.org/W3005798058', 'https://openalex.org/W2134664762', 'https://openalex.org/W2054341944', 'https://openalex.org/W2736601468', 'https://openalex.org/W2050233777', 'https://openalex.org/W2949304624', 'https://openalex.org/W2166206801', 'https://openalex.org/W2963440770', 'https://openalex.org/W2127958135', 'https://openalex.org/W1931823119', 'https://openalex.org/W2963830987', 'https://openalex.org/W2905333383', 'https://openalex.org/W2091163800', 'https://openalex.org/W2519766976', 'https://openalex.org/W2045908891', 'https://openalex.org/W2604086949', 'https://openalex.org/W2119170562', 'https://openalex.org/W2145404397', 'https://openalex.org/W3016391357', 'https://openalex.org/W2900152462', 'https://openalex.org/W2529004582', 'https://openalex.org/W2901943374', 'https://openalex.org/W2145339207', 'https://openalex.org/W2477844827', 'https://openalex.org/W2482290902', 'https://openalex.org/W2885097534', 'https://openalex.org/W2507556850']",2020-09-11

Previous approaches such as VQ-VAE use deep autoencoders to obtain compact representations, which are more practical as inputs for likelihood-based models. We present an alternative approach, inspired by common image compression methods like JPEG, and convert images to quantized discrete cosine transform (DCT) blocks, which are represented sparsely as a sequence of DCT channel, spatial location, and DCT coefficient triples. We propose a Transformer-based autoregressive architecture, which is trained to sequentially predict the conditional distribution of the next element in such sequences, and which scales effectively to high resolution images. On a range of image datasets, we demonstrate that our approach can generate high quality, diverse images, with sample metric scores competitive with state of the art methods. We additionally show that simple modifications to our method yield effective image colorization and super-resolution models.","['https://openalex.org/W2267126114', 'https://openalex.org/W2970607325', 'https://openalex.org/W2133665775', 'https://openalex.org/W2079145130', 'https://openalex.org/W3001279689', 'https://openalex.org/W2183341477', 'https://openalex.org/W2963981733', 'https://openalex.org/W1959608418', 'https://openalex.org/W2156886646', 'https://openalex.org/W3021164770', 'https://openalex.org/W2893749619', 'https://openalex.org/W2099471712', 'https://openalex.org/W2963139417', 'https://openalex.org/W2963090522', 'https://openalex.org/W3034445277', 'https://openalex.org/W3100971012', 'https://openalex.org/W2971074500', 'https://openalex.org/W2963799213', 'https://openalex.org/W2990440987', 'https://openalex.org/W2117539524', 'https://openalex.org/W3125056032', 'https://openalex.org/W3131922516', 'https://openalex.org/W2031614119', 'https://openalex.org/W2964121744', 'https://openalex.org/W2561715562', 'https://openalex.org/W967544008', 'https://openalex.org/W2140196014', 'https://openalex.org/W2962897886', 'https://openalex.org/W2962770929', 'https://openalex.org/W2902630600', 'https://openalex.org/W2994673210', 'https://openalex.org/W3035574324', 'https://openalex.org/W3010768098', 'https://openalex.org/W2962760235', 'https://openalex.org/W2971128425', 'https://openalex.org/W2963403868', 'https://openalex.org/W2940744433']",2021-03-05

However, they struggle to generate high-quality images, especially when samples are obtained from the prior without any tempering. One explanation for VAEs' poor generative quality is the prior hole problem: the prior distribution fails to match the aggregate approximate posterior. Due to this mismatch, there exist areas in the latent space with high density under the prior that do not correspond to any encoded image. Samples from those areas are decoded to corrupted images. To tackle this issue, we propose an energy-based prior defined by the product of a base prior distribution and a reweighting factor, designed to bring the base closer to the aggregate posterior. We train the reweighting factor by noise contrastive estimation, and we generalize it to hierarchical VAEs with many latent variable groups. Our experiments confirm that the proposed noise contrastive priors improve the generative performance of state-of-the-art VAEs by a large margin on the MNIST, CIFAR-10, CelebA 64, and CelebA HQ 256 datasets. Our method is simple and can be applied to a wide variety of VAEs to improve the expressivity of their prior distribution.","['https://openalex.org/W3034720584', 'https://openalex.org/W2897371726', 'https://openalex.org/W2963812505', 'https://openalex.org/W2788017640', 'https://openalex.org/W189596042', 'https://openalex.org/W2136922672', 'https://openalex.org/W2963408680', 'https://openalex.org/W2982553922', 'https://openalex.org/W3021164770', 'https://openalex.org/W2560512785', 'https://openalex.org/W2963420686', 'https://openalex.org/W2579277680', 'https://openalex.org/W2906007967', 'https://openalex.org/W3034625979', 'https://openalex.org/W2962738009', 'https://openalex.org/W1964155876', 'https://openalex.org/W1522301498', 'https://openalex.org/W2949382160', 'https://openalex.org/W3034667906', 'https://openalex.org/W2587284713', 'https://openalex.org/W2108501770', 'https://openalex.org/W2981721547', 'https://openalex.org/W2767286248', 'https://openalex.org/W2962771722', 'https://openalex.org/W3121345697', 'https://openalex.org/W1909320841', 'https://openalex.org/W2963746531', 'https://openalex.org/W2963801305', 'https://openalex.org/W2152790380', 'https://openalex.org/W3118605064', 'https://openalex.org/W2970014727', 'https://openalex.org/W3036167779', 'https://openalex.org/W2963082441', 'https://openalex.org/W2988793532', 'https://openalex.org/W2965850471', 'https://openalex.org/W2267126114', 'https://openalex.org/W2970771798', 'https://openalex.org/W1834627138', 'https://openalex.org/W3035101153', 'https://openalex.org/W2766527293', 'https://openalex.org/W2962770929', 'https://openalex.org/W2994610548', 'https://openalex.org/W2963981733', 'https://openalex.org/W3035068567', 'https://openalex.org/W3106570356', 'https://openalex.org/W2951870209', 'https://openalex.org/W2970607325', 'https://openalex.org/W2979473621', 'https://openalex.org/W2116064496', 'https://openalex.org/W2519430864', 'https://openalex.org/W1959608418', 'https://openalex.org/W2518108298', 'https://openalex.org/W2963139417', 'https://openalex.org/W2949899814', 'https://openalex.org/W1710476689', 'https://openalex.org/W3106068426', 'https://openalex.org/W2947490203', 'https://openalex.org/W2965095304', 'https://openalex.org/W2989574682', 'https://openalex.org/W2963135265', 'https://openalex.org/W3035166812', 'https://openalex.org/W2842511635', 'https://openalex.org/W2963147844', 'https://openalex.org/W2949649223', 'https://openalex.org/W1836465849', 'https://openalex.org/W3098510582', 'https://openalex.org/W3035564323', 'https://openalex.org/W2893749619', 'https://openalex.org/W2971074500', 'https://openalex.org/W2962820504', 'https://openalex.org/W3034310115', 'https://openalex.org/W3118608800', 'https://openalex.org/W2970554285', 'https://openalex.org/W2963799213', 'https://openalex.org/W2963686907']",2020-10-06

A vocabulary bottleneck in self-attention,"After their successful debut in natural language processing, Transformer architectures are now becoming the de-facto standard in many domains. An obstacle for their deployment over new modalities is the architectural configuration: the optimal depth-to-width ratio has been shown to dramatically vary across data types (e.g., $10$x larger over images than over language). We theoretically predict the existence of an embedding rank bottleneck that limits the contribution of self-attention width to the Transformer expressivity. We thus directly tie the input vocabulary size and rank to the optimal depth-to-width ratio, since a small vocabulary size or rank dictates an added advantage of depth over width. We empirically demonstrate the existence of this bottleneck and its implications on the depth-to-width interplay of Transformer architectures, linking the architecture variability across domains to the often glossed-over usage of different vocabulary sizes or embedding ranks in different domains. As an additional benefit, our rank bottlenecking framework allows us to identify size redundancies of $25\%-50\%$ in leading NLP models such as ALBERT and T5.","['https://openalex.org/W2962716426', 'https://openalex.org/W2611378001', 'https://openalex.org/W3099782249', 'https://openalex.org/W2949867299', 'https://openalex.org/W2994760783', 'https://openalex.org/W3169483174', 'https://openalex.org/W2963537482', 'https://openalex.org/W2963005248', 'https://openalex.org/W3130893544', 'https://openalex.org/W2963044468', 'https://openalex.org/W3035691519', 'https://openalex.org/W1984113816', 'https://openalex.org/W3001279689', 'https://openalex.org/W2935584311', 'https://openalex.org/W3026674654', 'https://openalex.org/W3034708491', 'https://openalex.org/W3119786062', 'https://openalex.org/W2963341956', 'https://openalex.org/W3035563045', 'https://openalex.org/W2912516940', 'https://openalex.org/W3095645723', 'https://openalex.org/W2982316857', 'https://openalex.org/W3164045210', 'https://openalex.org/W3098903812', 'https://openalex.org/W2963347649', 'https://openalex.org/W1980428773', 'https://openalex.org/W2121879602', 'https://openalex.org/W2934842096', 'https://openalex.org/W2006891733', 'https://openalex.org/W2963652331', 'https://openalex.org/W3034445277', 'https://openalex.org/W2626778328', 'https://openalex.org/W2995446988', 'https://openalex.org/W2940744433', 'https://openalex.org/W3082274269', 'https://openalex.org/W3169291081', 'https://openalex.org/W2970565456', 'https://openalex.org/W2962784628', 'https://openalex.org/W3021164770', 'https://openalex.org/W3114951884', 'https://openalex.org/W2996428491']",2021-05-09

This raises the question: if we have good enough generative models, do we still need datasets? We investigate this question in the setting of learning general-purpose visual representations from a black-box generative model rather than directly from data. Given an off-the-shelf image generator without any access to its training data, we train representations from the samples output by this generator. We compare several representation learning methods that can be applied to this setting, using the latent space of the generator to generate multiple ""views"" of the same semantic content. We show that for contrastive methods, this multiview data can naturally be used to identify positive pairs (nearby in latent space) and negative pairs (far apart in latent space). We find that the resulting representations rival or even outperform those learned directly from real data, but that good performance requires care in the sampling strategy applied and the training method. Generative models can be viewed as a compressed and organized copy of a dataset, and we envision a future where more and more ""model zoos"" proliferate while datasets become increasingly unwieldy, missing, or private. This paper suggests several techniques for dealing with visual representation learning in such a future.

https://openalex.org/W3206916870,https://doi.org/10.48550/arxiv.2110.10139,Chunked Autoregressive GAN for Conditional Waveform Synthesis,"Conditional waveform synthesis models learn a distribution of audio waveforms given conditioning such as text, mel-spectrograms, or MIDI. These systems employ deep generative models that model the waveform via either sequential (autoregressive) or parallel (non-autoregressive) sampling. Generative adversarial networks (GANs) have become a common choice for non-autoregressive waveform synthesis. However, state-of-the-art GAN-based models produce artifacts when performing mel-spectrogram inversion. In this paper, we demonstrate that these artifacts correspond with an inability for the generator to learn accurate pitch and periodicity. We show that simple pitch and periodicity conditioning is insufficient for reducing this error relative to using autoregression. We discuss the inductive bias that autoregression provides for learning the relationship between instantaneous frequency and phase, and show that this inductive bias holds even when autoregressively sampling large chunks of the waveform during each forward pass. Relative to prior state-of-the-art GAN-based models, our proposed model, Chunked Autoregressive GAN (CARGAN) reduces pitch error by 40-60%, reduces training time by 58%, maintains a fast generation speed suitable for real-time or interactive applications, and maintains or improves subjective quality.","['https://openalex.org/W2086381917', 'https://openalex.org/W3135287914', 'https://openalex.org/W3001377302', 'https://openalex.org/W2099471712', 'https://openalex.org/W2963300588', 'https://openalex.org/W2962866891', 'https://openalex.org/W2971074500', 'https://openalex.org/W2120847449', 'https://openalex.org/W3020570669', 'https://openalex.org/W2767785892', 'https://openalex.org/W2091425152', 'https://openalex.org/W2964307104', 'https://openalex.org/W3035068567', 'https://openalex.org/W2975414524', 'https://openalex.org/W1993950587', 'https://openalex.org/W2785678896', 'https://openalex.org/W3021164770', 'https://openalex.org/W1583912456', 'https://openalex.org/W2888916623', 'https://openalex.org/W2527729766', 'https://openalex.org/W2953331651', 'https://openalex.org/W2952344559', 'https://openalex.org/W3047796745', 'https://openalex.org/W2963139417', 'https://openalex.org/W2950547518', 'https://openalex.org/W3092028330', 'https://openalex.org/W3123097577', 'https://openalex.org/W2940744433', 'https://openalex.org/W3112587064', 'https://openalex.org/W2964167449', 'https://openalex.org/W2959300817', 'https://openalex.org/W3036167779', 'https://openalex.org/W2950635152', 'https://openalex.org/W3169905056', 'https://openalex.org/W2194775991', 'https://openalex.org/W2963981733', 'https://openalex.org/W2471520273', 'https://openalex.org/W3034794073', 'https://openalex.org/W2949382160', 'https://openalex.org/W1505878979', 'https://openalex.org/W2950541952', 'https://openalex.org/W2069501481', 'https://openalex.org/W3033913438', 'https://openalex.org/W2980709326']",2021-10-19

The model uses a Modified Discrete Cosine Transform (MDCT) data representation, which includes all phase information. Phase generation is hence integral part of the model. We leverage the auditory masking and psychoacoustic perception limit of the human ear to widen the true distribution and stabilize the training process. The model architecture is a deep 2D convolutional network, where each subsequent generator model block increases the resolution along the time axis and adds a higher octave along the frequency axis. The deeper layers are connected with all parts of the output and have the context of the full track. This enables generation of samples which exhibit long-range coherence. We use MP3net to create 95s stereo tracks with a 22kHz sample rate after training for 250h on a single Cloud TPUv2. An additional benefit of the CNN-based model architecture is that generation of new songs is almost instantaneous.","['https://openalex.org/W2962770929', 'https://openalex.org/W2953030256', 'https://openalex.org/W2910577860', 'https://openalex.org/W2535388113', 'https://openalex.org/W2893749619', 'https://openalex.org/W1916685473', 'https://openalex.org/W2948211236', 'https://openalex.org/W2962914733', 'https://openalex.org/W3215191595', 'https://openalex.org/W2894295011', 'https://openalex.org/W2120847449', 'https://openalex.org/W2803968356', 'https://openalex.org/W2963575853', 'https://openalex.org/W2808631503', 'https://openalex.org/W2965141076', 'https://openalex.org/W2617573776', 'https://openalex.org/W2962760235', 'https://openalex.org/W2917245127', 'https://openalex.org/W2962879692', 'https://openalex.org/W2963681776', 'https://openalex.org/W2898148140', 'https://openalex.org/W2964201867', 'https://openalex.org/W1710476689', 'https://openalex.org/W2096588881', 'https://openalex.org/W2804078698', 'https://openalex.org/W2982039329', 'https://openalex.org/W1502560247', 'https://openalex.org/W3021164770', 'https://openalex.org/W2004453603', 'https://openalex.org/W2949382160']",2021-01-12

Here, we illustrate that capturing the essence of an audio source is typically possible from as little as a few tens of seconds from a single training signal. Specifically, we present a GAN-based generative model that can be trained on one short audio signal from any domain (e.g. speech, music, etc.) and does not require pre-training or any other form of external supervision. Once trained, our model can generate random samples of arbitrary duration that maintain semantic similarity to the training waveform, yet exhibit new compositions of its audio primitives. This enables a long line of interesting applications, including generating new jazz improvisations or new a-cappella rap variants based on a single short example, producing coherent modifications to famous songs (e.g. adding a new verse to a Beatles song based solely on the original recording), filling-in of missing parts (inpainting), extending the bandwidth of a speech signal (super-resolution), and enhancing old recordings without access to any clean training example. We show that in all cases, no more than 20 seconds of training audio commonly suffice for our model to achieve state-of-the-art results.

https://openalex.org/W3041199652,https://doi.org/10.48550/arxiv.2007.04590,DeepSinger: Singing Voice Synthesis with Data Mined From the Web,"In this paper, we develop DeepSinger, a multi-lingual multi-singer singing voice synthesis (SVS) system, which is built from scratch using singing training data mined from music websites. The pipeline of DeepSinger consists of several steps, including data crawling, singing and accompaniment separation, lyrics-to-singing alignment, data filtration, and singing modeling. Specifically, we design a lyrics-to-singing alignment model to automatically extract the duration of each phoneme in lyrics starting from coarse-grained sentence level to fine-grained phoneme level, and further design a multi-lingual multi-singer singing model based on a feed-forward Transformer to directly generate linear-spectrograms from lyrics, and synthesize voices using Griffin-Lim. DeepSinger has several advantages over previous SVS systems: 1) to the best of our knowledge, it is the first SVS system that directly mines training data from music websites, 2) the lyrics-to-singing alignment model further avoids any human efforts for alignment labeling and greatly reduces labeling cost, 3) the singing model based on a feed-forward Transformer is simple and efficient, by removing the complicated acoustic feature modeling in parametric synthesis and leveraging a reference encoder to capture the timbre of a singer from noisy singing data, and 4) it can synthesize singing voices in multiple languages and multiple singers. We evaluate DeepSinger on our mined singing dataset that consists of about 92 hours data from 89 singers on three languages (Chinese, Cantonese and English). The results demonstrate that with the singing data purely mined from the Web, DeepSinger can synthesize high-quality singing voices in terms of both pitch accuracy and voice naturalness (footnote: Our audio samples are shown in https://speechresearch.github.io/deepsinger/.)","['https://openalex.org/W2963403868', 'https://openalex.org/W2984106626', 'https://openalex.org/W2950161879', 'https://openalex.org/W2584505851', 'https://openalex.org/W2515336442', 'https://openalex.org/W2902351815', 'https://openalex.org/W3033411150', 'https://openalex.org/W2972359262', 'https://openalex.org/W2964243274', 'https://openalex.org/W2964307104', 'https://openalex.org/W2598638573', 'https://openalex.org/W2736648940', 'https://openalex.org/W2747874407', 'https://openalex.org/W2482558056', 'https://openalex.org/W2108862644', 'https://openalex.org/W2767052532', 'https://openalex.org/W2940405045', 'https://openalex.org/W2134387846', 'https://openalex.org/W3021164770', 'https://openalex.org/W2284628133', 'https://openalex.org/W2778460379', 'https://openalex.org/W3035430139', 'https://openalex.org/W182406043', 'https://openalex.org/W1875231349', 'https://openalex.org/W2949382160', 'https://openalex.org/W2973046048', 'https://openalex.org/W2150658333', 'https://openalex.org/W1522301498', 'https://openalex.org/W2955316069', 'https://openalex.org/W2007815473', 'https://openalex.org/W2970597249', 'https://openalex.org/W2995670387', 'https://openalex.org/W2935701729', 'https://openalex.org/W2937242376', 'https://openalex.org/W2946200149', 'https://openalex.org/W1904711963', 'https://openalex.org/W2962936105', 'https://openalex.org/W2743200750']",2020-07-09

Existing models are not yet able to capture all these constraints effectively, especially for long-term music generation. To address this problem, we propose AccoMontage, an accompaniment arrangement system for whole pieces of music through unifying phrase selection and neural style transfer. We focus on generating piano accompaniments for folk/pop songs based on a lead sheet (i.e., melody with chord progression). Specifically, AccoMontage first retrieves phrase montages from a database while recombining them structurally using dynamic programming. Second, chords of the retrieved phrases are manipulated to match the lead sheet via style transfer. Lastly, the system offers controls over the generation process. In contrast to pure learning-based approaches, AccoMontage introduces a novel hybrid pathway, in which rule-based optimization and deep learning are both leveraged to complement each other for high-quality generation. Experiments show that our model generates well-structured accompaniment with delicate texture, significantly outperforming the baselines.","['https://openalex.org/W3049637270', 'https://openalex.org/W3092850823', 'https://openalex.org/W3049174246', 'https://openalex.org/W3021164770', 'https://openalex.org/W2884558435', 'https://openalex.org/W2773479825', 'https://openalex.org/W2809621972', 'https://openalex.org/W3005441616', 'https://openalex.org/W2793183272', 'https://openalex.org/W3093276169', 'https://openalex.org/W2626778328', 'https://openalex.org/W2964121744', 'https://openalex.org/W3049247973', 'https://openalex.org/W2746068898', 'https://openalex.org/W2561662441', 'https://openalex.org/W2142996485', 'https://openalex.org/W2021142183', 'https://openalex.org/W2400684038', 'https://openalex.org/W2797595207', 'https://openalex.org/W2142384583', 'https://openalex.org/W1966910303', 'https://openalex.org/W2948574791', 'https://openalex.org/W2963032576', 'https://openalex.org/W2591553092', 'https://openalex.org/W1993297272', 'https://openalex.org/W2399081453', 'https://openalex.org/W2963681776', 'https://openalex.org/W2978885571', 'https://openalex.org/W1665214252']",2021-08-25

Existing solutions rely either on server-side methods or focus on hiding speaker identity. While these approaches reduce certain security concerns, they do not give users client-side control over whether their biometric information is sent to the server. In this paper, we formally define client-side privacy and discuss its three unique technical challenges: (1) direct manipulation of raw data on client devices, (2) adaptability with a broad range of server-side processing models, and (3) low time and space complexity for compatibility with limited-bandwidth devices. Solving these challenges requires new models that achieve high-fidelity reconstruction, privacy preservation of sensitive personal attributes, and efficiency during training and inference. As a step towards client-side privacy for speech recognition, we investigate three techniques spanning signal processing, disentangled representation learning, and adversarial training. Through a series of gender and accent masking tasks, we observe that each method has its unique strengths, but none manage to effectively balance the trade-offs between performance, privacy, and complexity. These insights call for more research in client-side privacy to ensure a safer deployment of cloud-based speech processing services.","['https://openalex.org/W2950888501', 'https://openalex.org/W3092368332', 'https://openalex.org/W2896422817', 'https://openalex.org/W3092178912', 'https://openalex.org/W1966092470', 'https://openalex.org/W1967689022', 'https://openalex.org/W2124221655', 'https://openalex.org/W2963830550', 'https://openalex.org/W2963207607', 'https://openalex.org/W2777914285', 'https://openalex.org/W2951082691', 'https://openalex.org/W3119841746', 'https://openalex.org/W2791827614', 'https://openalex.org/W3103802018', 'https://openalex.org/W3156977108', 'https://openalex.org/W3098439673', 'https://openalex.org/W2128977689', 'https://openalex.org/W2527729766', 'https://openalex.org/W3109527089', 'https://openalex.org/W2122332734', 'https://openalex.org/W3043999252', 'https://openalex.org/W2807692250', 'https://openalex.org/W2963374540', 'https://openalex.org/W3111653141', 'https://openalex.org/W1568514080', 'https://openalex.org/W3163573274', 'https://openalex.org/W2903652364', 'https://openalex.org/W2726515241', 'https://openalex.org/W2293829681', 'https://openalex.org/W3034515139', 'https://openalex.org/W2121727866', 'https://openalex.org/W2099471712', 'https://openalex.org/W1993152556', 'https://openalex.org/W3100779497', 'https://openalex.org/W2120847449', 'https://openalex.org/W3099782249', 'https://openalex.org/W2896479683', 'https://openalex.org/W2318363391', 'https://openalex.org/W2962835968', 'https://openalex.org/W2535690855', 'https://openalex.org/W2473418344', 'https://openalex.org/W2903538854', 'https://openalex.org/W1886794424', 'https://openalex.org/W1965752326', 'https://openalex.org/W2584455886', 'https://openalex.org/W3021164770', 'https://openalex.org/W3095232705', 'https://openalex.org/W2519091744', 'https://openalex.org/W3018464563', 'https://openalex.org/W2972608701', 'https://openalex.org/W2996974038', 'https://openalex.org/W3045412325', 'https://openalex.org/W2951246258', 'https://openalex.org/W2035985557', 'https://openalex.org/W3098557217', 'https://openalex.org/W2962780374', 'https://openalex.org/W3162893999', 'https://openalex.org/W1982697667', 'https://openalex.org/W2972659941', 'https://openalex.org/W3082522567', 'https://openalex.org/W2104779640', 'https://openalex.org/W2753738274', 'https://openalex.org/W2502312327', 'https://openalex.org/W2603777577', 'https://openalex.org/W1494198834', 'https://openalex.org/W3110801570', 'https://openalex.org/W2902113386']",2021-01-22

Autoregressive models are typically sampled sequentially, according to the transition dynamics defined by the model. Instead, we propose a sampling procedure that initializes a sequence with white noise and follows a Markov chain defined by Langevin dynamics on the global log-likelihood of the sequence. This approach parallelizes the sampling process and generalizes to conditional sampling. Using an autoregressive model as a Bayesian prior, we can steer the output of a generative model using a conditional likelihood or constraints. We apply these techniques to autoregressive models in the visual and audio domains, with competitive results for audio source separation, super-resolution, and inpainting.","['https://openalex.org/W3021164770', 'https://openalex.org/W2138243089', 'https://openalex.org/W2950788055', 'https://openalex.org/W2990594533', 'https://openalex.org/W3004714107', 'https://openalex.org/W3035369987', 'https://openalex.org/W2963420272', 'https://openalex.org/W2963782041', 'https://openalex.org/W2964122153', 'https://openalex.org/W3121345697', 'https://openalex.org/W2964058413', 'https://openalex.org/W3035586199', 'https://openalex.org/W3097649562', 'https://openalex.org/W2058676219', 'https://openalex.org/W2173213060', 'https://openalex.org/W2970006822', 'https://openalex.org/W3105013723', 'https://openalex.org/W2135181320', 'https://openalex.org/W2503750833', 'https://openalex.org/W3030163527', 'https://openalex.org/W3010316883', 'https://openalex.org/W2990504376', 'https://openalex.org/W2971034910', 'https://openalex.org/W2604885021', 'https://openalex.org/W3118608800', 'https://openalex.org/W2267126114', 'https://openalex.org/W2963575853', 'https://openalex.org/W3172257043', 'https://openalex.org/W3129651364', 'https://openalex.org/W2963975282', 'https://openalex.org/W2971074500', 'https://openalex.org/W2296153915', 'https://openalex.org/W2964101377', 'https://openalex.org/W2123597716', 'https://openalex.org/W2952218014', 'https://openalex.org/W2118297240', 'https://openalex.org/W2894295011', 'https://openalex.org/W3123097577', 'https://openalex.org/W2940744433', 'https://openalex.org/W2951781666', 'https://openalex.org/W2595294663', 'https://openalex.org/W2949382160', 'https://openalex.org/W2996287690', 'https://openalex.org/W2962882868', 'https://openalex.org/W2963186101', 'https://openalex.org/W2902662422', 'https://openalex.org/W2478027467', 'https://openalex.org/W3035068567', 'https://openalex.org/W2929274168', 'https://openalex.org/W2167433878', 'https://openalex.org/W2963300588', 'https://openalex.org/W2584032004']",2021-05-17

However, under an unsupervised-style setting, typical training algorithms for controllable sequence generative models suffer from the training-inference mismatch, where the same sample is used as content and style input during training but unpaired samples are given during inference. In this paper, we tackle the training-inference mismatch encountered during unsupervised learning of controllable generative sequence models. The proposed method is simple yet effective, where we use a style transformation module to transfer target style information into an unrelated style input. This method enables training using unpaired content and style samples and thereby mitigate the training-inference mismatch. We apply style equalization to text-to-speech and text-to-handwriting synthesis on three datasets. We conduct thorough evaluation, including both quantitative and qualitative user studies. Our results show that by mitigating the training-inference mismatch with the proposed style equalization, we achieve style replication scores comparable to real data in our user studies.","['https://openalex.org/W3016160783', 'https://openalex.org/W2902070858', 'https://openalex.org/W1810943226', 'https://openalex.org/W3034909238', 'https://openalex.org/W2168254078', 'https://openalex.org/W2962972936', 'https://openalex.org/W3082130377', 'https://openalex.org/W2972359262', 'https://openalex.org/W3109645351', 'https://openalex.org/W2964121744', 'https://openalex.org/W2949281321', 'https://openalex.org/W2890964092', 'https://openalex.org/W2963432880', 'https://openalex.org/W2963539064', 'https://openalex.org/W3021164770', 'https://openalex.org/W2963801463', 'https://openalex.org/W2963073614', 'https://openalex.org/W3101254953', 'https://openalex.org/W2787887017', 'https://openalex.org/W592244745', 'https://openalex.org/W2969985801', 'https://openalex.org/W3024920698', 'https://openalex.org/W2808631503', 'https://openalex.org/W2903141607', 'https://openalex.org/W2911424785', 'https://openalex.org/W3098304089', 'https://openalex.org/W3035446294', 'https://openalex.org/W3126649386', 'https://openalex.org/W2588445447', 'https://openalex.org/W2462831000', 'https://openalex.org/W2963712897', 'https://openalex.org/W2963300588', 'https://openalex.org/W3015645837', 'https://openalex.org/W2962752582', 'https://openalex.org/W2112606109', 'https://openalex.org/W3092947864', 'https://openalex.org/W3015212100', 'https://openalex.org/W2339254090', 'https://openalex.org/W2972667718', 'https://openalex.org/W2963920537', 'https://openalex.org/W3034794073', 'https://openalex.org/W2962793481', 'https://openalex.org/W3035574324', 'https://openalex.org/W3108367042', 'https://openalex.org/W3128910262', 'https://openalex.org/W2963272440', 'https://openalex.org/W2963403868', 'https://openalex.org/W2913314773', 'https://openalex.org/W2937579788', 'https://openalex.org/W3033913438', 'https://openalex.org/W1990457366', 'https://openalex.org/W2899663614', 'https://openalex.org/W2963691546', 'https://openalex.org/W2784512264', 'https://openalex.org/W3122089380', 'https://openalex.org/W3139980562', 'https://openalex.org/W3003162010', 'https://openalex.org/W2963568578', 'https://openalex.org/W1959608418', 'https://openalex.org/W3041816239', 'https://openalex.org/W3034431451', 'https://openalex.org/W3034776267', 'https://openalex.org/W3020570669', 'https://openalex.org/W3113687514', 'https://openalex.org/W3033411150', 'https://openalex.org/W2893749619', 'https://openalex.org/W3035653890', 'https://openalex.org/W2964243274', 'https://openalex.org/W2985832137']",2021-10-06

Our task is trivial for humans but difficult for these audio distances, suggesting significant progress can be made in self-supervised audio learning by improving current losses.","['https://openalex.org/W2939574508', 'https://openalex.org/W2032197604', 'https://openalex.org/W2964153729', 'https://openalex.org/W2154455356', 'https://openalex.org/W2624871570', 'https://openalex.org/W2963945466', 'https://openalex.org/W2074619556', 'https://openalex.org/W3094917204', 'https://openalex.org/W2054139811', 'https://openalex.org/W2963542245', 'https://openalex.org/W2935711438', 'https://openalex.org/W1821462560', 'https://openalex.org/W2054941444', 'https://openalex.org/W2250539671', 'https://openalex.org/W1969351858', 'https://openalex.org/W3095717210', 'https://openalex.org/W2970006822', 'https://openalex.org/W3100511085', 'https://openalex.org/W2886022419', 'https://openalex.org/W1559569201', 'https://openalex.org/W3090388844', 'https://openalex.org/W2948445958', 'https://openalex.org/W2098950531', 'https://openalex.org/W2990440871', 'https://openalex.org/W2972597685', 'https://openalex.org/W3015338123', 'https://openalex.org/W2995233853', 'https://openalex.org/W2995254904', 'https://openalex.org/W3021164770', 'https://openalex.org/W3047579126', 'https://openalex.org/W2584032004', 'https://openalex.org/W2890043615', 'https://openalex.org/W2962785568', 'https://openalex.org/W3095617022', 'https://openalex.org/W1966365432', 'https://openalex.org/W2963975282', 'https://openalex.org/W2071640183', 'https://openalex.org/W2024310757', 'https://openalex.org/W2964307104', 'https://openalex.org/W2084044763', 'https://openalex.org/W2963799213', 'https://openalex.org/W3124061379', 'https://openalex.org/W2124229063', 'https://openalex.org/W2012922111', 'https://openalex.org/W3103557498', 'https://openalex.org/W3097934054', 'https://openalex.org/W2972443522', 'https://openalex.org/W3016115629', 'https://openalex.org/W1976878132', 'https://openalex.org/W2519091744', 'https://openalex.org/W1986595194', 'https://openalex.org/W3100307207', 'https://openalex.org/W2124864596', 'https://openalex.org/W3083833857', 'https://openalex.org/W3125709657', 'https://openalex.org/W3037149862', 'https://openalex.org/W85455704', 'https://openalex.org/W2158899491', 'https://openalex.org/W3099782249', 'https://openalex.org/W3021066808', 'https://openalex.org/W2962866891', 'https://openalex.org/W2774707525', 'https://openalex.org/W2963609956', 'https://openalex.org/W2980286501', 'https://openalex.org/W2605102758', 'https://openalex.org/W2008066450', 'https://openalex.org/W2103869314', 'https://openalex.org/W2989708046', 'https://openalex.org/W3094749184', 'https://openalex.org/W2606176153', 'https://openalex.org/W2111460811', 'https://openalex.org/W2526050071']",2020-12-08

We present a comprehensive set of deterministic transformations that can be inserted as distinct layers into the computational graph of a trained generative neural network and applied during inference. In addition, we present a novel algorithm for clustering features based on their spatial activation maps. This allows features to be grouped together based on spatial similarity in an unsupervised fashion. This results in the meaningful manipulation of sets of features that correspond to the generation of a broad array of semantically significant aspects of the generated images. We demonstrate these transformations on the official pre-trained StyleGAN2 model trained on the FFHQ dataset. In doing so, we lay the groundwork for future interactive multimedia where the inner representation of deep generative models are manipulated for greater creative expression, whilst also increasing our understanding of how such black-box systems can be more meaningfully interpreted.","['https://openalex.org/W2970971581', 'https://openalex.org/W2951004968', 'https://openalex.org/W2963577681', 'https://openalex.org/W1909320841', 'https://openalex.org/W2121949863', 'https://openalex.org/W2610018085', 'https://openalex.org/W2962851944', 'https://openalex.org/W2901107321', 'https://openalex.org/W183625566', 'https://openalex.org/W2963996492', 'https://openalex.org/W2099471712', 'https://openalex.org/W2150593711', 'https://openalex.org/W1915485278', 'https://openalex.org/W2962770929', 'https://openalex.org/W2148349024', 'https://openalex.org/W2059515884', 'https://openalex.org/W2737258237', 'https://openalex.org/W2963684088', 'https://openalex.org/W3014852036', 'https://openalex.org/W2934375473', 'https://openalex.org/W2133547499', 'https://openalex.org/W2995327724', 'https://openalex.org/W3021164770']",2020-05-25

This paper describes Diffusion-Decoding models with Contrastive representations (D2C), a paradigm for training unconditional variational autoencoders (VAEs) for few-shot conditional image generation. D2C uses a learned diffusion-based prior over the latent representations to improve generation and contrastive self-supervised learning to improve representation quality. D2C can adapt to novel generation tasks conditioned on labels or manipulation constraints, by learning from as few as 100 labeled examples. On conditional generation from new labels, D2C achieves superior performance over state-of-the-art VAEs and diffusion models. On conditional image manipulation, D2C generations are two orders of magnitude faster to produce over StyleGAN2 ones and are preferred by 50% - 60% of the human evaluators in a double-blind study.","['https://openalex.org/W2922772346', 'https://openalex.org/W2963592272', 'https://openalex.org/W2963800363', 'https://openalex.org/W2963522749', 'https://openalex.org/W2321533354', 'https://openalex.org/W3034279703', 'https://openalex.org/W3035068567', 'https://openalex.org/W3045338699', 'https://openalex.org/W2767757834', 'https://openalex.org/W2842511635', 'https://openalex.org/W2687693326', 'https://openalex.org/W3135367836', 'https://openalex.org/W2964167449', 'https://openalex.org/W2963073614', 'https://openalex.org/W2559626456', 'https://openalex.org/W2129069237', 'https://openalex.org/W2963799213', 'https://openalex.org/W2949649223', 'https://openalex.org/W3129576130', 'https://openalex.org/W2617620476', 'https://openalex.org/W2788017640', 'https://openalex.org/W2405756170', 'https://openalex.org/W3135995094', 'https://openalex.org/W2910601191', 'https://openalex.org/W3110257065', 'https://openalex.org/W2963785576', 'https://openalex.org/W2785678896', 'https://openalex.org/W2988793532', 'https://openalex.org/W2029164135', 'https://openalex.org/W2947708079', 'https://openalex.org/W2904367110', 'https://openalex.org/W3174194560', 'https://openalex.org/W2981479880', 'https://openalex.org/W2412320034', 'https://openalex.org/W3092442149', 'https://openalex.org/W2125389028', 'https://openalex.org/W2962927829', 'https://openalex.org/W2622563070', 'https://openalex.org/W2805177834', 'https://openalex.org/W3162926177', 'https://openalex.org/W2953318193', 'https://openalex.org/W2904539038', 'https://openalex.org/W2409550820', 'https://openalex.org/W2963981733', 'https://openalex.org/W3035058308', 'https://openalex.org/W3092033429', 'https://openalex.org/W3035060554', 'https://openalex.org/W3102061158', 'https://openalex.org/W3037879915', 'https://openalex.org/W2949382160', 'https://openalex.org/W3030163527', 'https://openalex.org/W3042786565', 'https://openalex.org/W3135404760', 'https://openalex.org/W2116064496', 'https://openalex.org/W2808746463', 'https://openalex.org/W3021164770', 'https://openalex.org/W3040462728', 'https://openalex.org/W1583912456', 'https://openalex.org/W2411541852', 'https://openalex.org/W2789776893', 'https://openalex.org/W2594057160', 'https://openalex.org/W2123958887', 'https://openalex.org/W3106570356', 'https://openalex.org/W2799251726', 'https://openalex.org/W3140373187', 'https://openalex.org/W2530741948', 'https://openalex.org/W2164452299', 'https://openalex.org/W2766527293', 'https://openalex.org/W3133191702', 'https://openalex.org/W2944828972', 'https://openalex.org/W3145450063', 'https://openalex.org/W3107668149', 'https://openalex.org/W3209501356', 'https://openalex.org/W3041956526', 'https://openalex.org/W2557449848', 'https://openalex.org/W2947590261', 'https://openalex.org/W2809595412', 'https://openalex.org/W3180268133', 'https://openalex.org/W2587284713', 'https://openalex.org/W1861492603', 'https://openalex.org/W2963341956', 'https://openalex.org/W2951004968', 'https://openalex.org/W2959300817', 'https://openalex.org/W3148695041', 'https://openalex.org/W3035574324', 'https://openalex.org/W3098708719', 'https://openalex.org/W3005680577', 'https://openalex.org/W3034431451', 'https://openalex.org/W1834627138', 'https://openalex.org/W2163605009', 'https://openalex.org/W2987283559', 'https://openalex.org/W299440670', 'https://openalex.org/W2911290044', 'https://openalex.org/W2893749619', 'https://openalex.org/W2962937159', 'https://openalex.org/W2099471712', 'https://openalex.org/W3036167779', 'https://openalex.org/W2985060393', 'https://openalex.org/W2524985544', 'https://openalex.org/W2949650786', 'https://openalex.org/W3009561768', 'https://openalex.org/W2964268978', 'https://openalex.org/W2155292833']",2021-06-12

On the other hand, approaches for training these models without any direct supervision are typically high-demanding in terms of memory and time requirements, and remain impractical to be used at inference time. We aim to tackle these limitations by proposing a simple yet effective unsupervised separation algorithm, which operates directly on a latent representation of time-domain signals. Our algorithm relies on deep Bayesian priors in the form of pre-trained autoregressive networks to model the probability distributions of each source. We leverage the low cardinality of the discrete latent space, trained with a novel loss term imposing a precise arithmetic structure on it, to perform exact Bayesian inference without relying on an approximation strategy. We validate our approach on the Slakh dataset arXiv:1909.08494, demonstrating results in line with state of the art supervised approaches while requiring fewer resources with respect to other unsupervised methods.","['https://openalex.org/W2991107219', 'https://openalex.org/W3160695487', 'https://openalex.org/W2998490864', 'https://openalex.org/W2669032454', 'https://openalex.org/W2971074500', 'https://openalex.org/W2892365986', 'https://openalex.org/W2990594533', 'https://openalex.org/W3035369987', 'https://openalex.org/W3093725184', 'https://openalex.org/W2949382160', 'https://openalex.org/W2963799213', 'https://openalex.org/W3090496396', 'https://openalex.org/W2099741732', 'https://openalex.org/W1594771616', 'https://openalex.org/W2135181320', 'https://openalex.org/W2168793898', 'https://openalex.org/W3021164770', 'https://openalex.org/W3030191531', 'https://openalex.org/W2162514423']",2021-10-11

Divergence frontiers have recently been proposed as an evaluation framework for generative models, due to their ability to measure the quality-diversity trade-off inherent to deep generative modeling. However, the statistical behavior of divergence frontiers estimated from data remains unknown to this day. In this paper, we establish non-asymptotic bounds on the sample complexity of the plug-in estimator of divergence frontiers. Along the way, we introduce a novel integral summary of divergence frontiers. We derive the corresponding non-asymptotic bounds and discuss the choice of the quantization level by balancing the two types of approximation errors arisen from its computation. We also augment the divergence frontier framework by investigating the statistical performance of smoothed distribution estimators such as the Good-Turing estimator. We illustrate the theoretical results with numerical examples from natural language processing and computer vision.","['https://openalex.org/W3036010930', 'https://openalex.org/W1989661300', 'https://openalex.org/W2971073828', 'https://openalex.org/W3104876213', 'https://openalex.org/W2963383053', 'https://openalex.org/W2171585891', 'https://openalex.org/W2171846551', 'https://openalex.org/W2187207766', 'https://openalex.org/W2964316188', 'https://openalex.org/W1638306878', 'https://openalex.org/W3107128594', 'https://openalex.org/W1585701772', 'https://openalex.org/W2158195707', 'https://openalex.org/W2593414223', 'https://openalex.org/W2963373786', 'https://openalex.org/W3034723908', 'https://openalex.org/W2117058215', 'https://openalex.org/W2963139417', 'https://openalex.org/W2963981733', 'https://openalex.org/W2963305780', 'https://openalex.org/W2194775991', 'https://openalex.org/W2134237567', 'https://openalex.org/W2971128425', 'https://openalex.org/W3021164770', 'https://openalex.org/W3118608800', 'https://openalex.org/W2149268774', 'https://openalex.org/W2159178073', 'https://openalex.org/W2963289805', 'https://openalex.org/W2082092506', 'https://openalex.org/W2059800182', 'https://openalex.org/W2964121406', 'https://openalex.org/W2129058877', 'https://openalex.org/W2804456710', 'https://openalex.org/W2946193058', 'https://openalex.org/W597395834', 'https://openalex.org/W2964000438', 'https://openalex.org/W2753300133', 'https://openalex.org/W2963224888', 'https://openalex.org/W2166944917', 'https://openalex.org/W2805984778', 'https://openalex.org/W2151835418', 'https://openalex.org/W2014404824', 'https://openalex.org/W2114207451', 'https://openalex.org/W1999120268', 'https://openalex.org/W3098824823', 'https://openalex.org/W2971008823', 'https://openalex.org/W2962919088', 'https://openalex.org/W2055309977', 'https://openalex.org/W2963494889', 'https://openalex.org/W2803713489', 'https://openalex.org/W2962770929', 'https://openalex.org/W3037652471', 'https://openalex.org/W2125232050', 'https://openalex.org/W3098903812', 'https://openalex.org/W583278954']",2021-06-15

Our system, consisting of different modules for each groove component, takes a two-step approach that is analogous to a music creation process. First, the note module updates the user template through addition and deletion of notes; Second, the velocity and microtiming modules add details to this generated note score. In order to model the drum notes, we apply a discrete latent representation method via Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoder (VQ-VAE), as drum notes have a discrete property, unlike velocity and microtiming values. We show that our two-step approach and the usage of a discrete encoding space improves the learning of the original data distribution. Additionally, we discuss the benefit of incorporating control elements - genre, velocity and microtiming patterns - into the model.","['https://openalex.org/W1924770834', 'https://openalex.org/W3107097936', 'https://openalex.org/W2963408210', 'https://openalex.org/W2963522749', 'https://openalex.org/W3136272958', 'https://openalex.org/W2283630710', 'https://openalex.org/W2253682605', 'https://openalex.org/W2963799213', 'https://openalex.org/W3210904914', 'https://openalex.org/W2927380283', 'https://openalex.org/W2016063099', 'https://openalex.org/W2946521317', 'https://openalex.org/W2990617740', 'https://openalex.org/W2963330667', 'https://openalex.org/W3127854286', 'https://openalex.org/W3098518646', 'https://openalex.org/W3161301744', 'https://openalex.org/W2397980357', 'https://openalex.org/W3021164770', 'https://openalex.org/W3014809999', 'https://openalex.org/W2996383576', 'https://openalex.org/W2963800363', 'https://openalex.org/W2962212541', 'https://openalex.org/W2511667032', 'https://openalex.org/W2087870700', 'https://openalex.org/W3015287975']",2021-07-11

An audio generation model is conditioned on an input mixture, producing a latent encoding of the audio used to generate audio. This generated audio is fed to a pretrained music tagger that creates source labels. The cross-entropy loss between the tag distribution for the generated audio and a predefined distribution for an isolated source is used to guide gradient ascent in the (unchanging) latent space of the generative model. This system does not update the weights of the generative model or the tagger, and only relies on moving through the generative model's latent space to produce separated sources. We use OpenAI's Jukebox as the pretrained generative model, and we couple it with four kinds of pretrained music taggers (two architectures and two tagging datasets). Experimental results on two source separation datasets, show this approach can produce separation estimates for a wider variety of sources than any tested supervised or unsupervised system. This work points to the vast and heretofore untapped potential of large pretrained music models for audio-to-audio tasks like source separation.","['https://openalex.org/W3015289235', 'https://openalex.org/W1561135842', 'https://openalex.org/W3180355996', 'https://openalex.org/W2972411915', 'https://openalex.org/W3180663620', 'https://openalex.org/W2963207607', 'https://openalex.org/W2414894569', 'https://openalex.org/W3104704316', 'https://openalex.org/W3160751854', 'https://openalex.org/W2127851351', 'https://openalex.org/W2296573765', 'https://openalex.org/W3082274269', 'https://openalex.org/W2950060770', 'https://openalex.org/W3030163527', 'https://openalex.org/W3015213533', 'https://openalex.org/W3135367836', 'https://openalex.org/W2027884847', 'https://openalex.org/W3197781391', 'https://openalex.org/W2998490864', 'https://openalex.org/W2971074500', 'https://openalex.org/W2127870748', 'https://openalex.org/W3029858316', 'https://openalex.org/W2990594533', 'https://openalex.org/W2963992487', 'https://openalex.org/W3100954996', 'https://openalex.org/W3021164770']",2021-10-25

These tools attract much attention from the media, artists, researchers, and investors. Because these tools are data-driven, they are inherently different than the traditional creative tools which arises the question - who may own the content that is generated by these tools? In this paper we aim to address this question, we start by providing a background to this problem, raising several candidates that may own the content and arguments for each one of them. Then we propose a possible algorithmic solution in the vision-based model's regime.

However, these methods generate shapes with limited fidelity and diversity. We introduce CLIP-Sculptor, a method to address these constraints by producing high-fidelity and diverse 3D shapes without the need for (text, shape) pairs during training. CLIP-Sculptor achieves this in a multi-resolution approach that first generates in a low-dimensional latent space and then upscales to a higher resolution for improved shape fidelity. For improved shape diversity, we use a discrete latent space which is modeled using a transformer conditioned on CLIP's image-text embedding space. We also present a novel variant of classifier-free guidance, which improves the accuracy-diversity trade-off. Finally, we perform extensive experiments demonstrating that CLIP-Sculptor outperforms state-of-the-art baselines.","['https://openalex.org/W2194775991', 'https://openalex.org/W4312933868', 'https://openalex.org/W4312388283', 'https://openalex.org/W3201927751', 'https://openalex.org/W6765779288', 'https://openalex.org/W6809885388', 'https://openalex.org/W6762931180', 'https://openalex.org/W6790978476', 'https://openalex.org/W2987068636', 'https://openalex.org/W6748208425', 'https://openalex.org/W3173631825', 'https://openalex.org/W6840815571', 'https://openalex.org/W6810165261', 'https://openalex.org/W6842746547', 'https://openalex.org/W4312708649', 'https://openalex.org/W2963926543', 'https://openalex.org/W4312638666', 'https://openalex.org/W4312910764', 'https://openalex.org/W4313041309', 'https://openalex.org/W6810452849', 'https://openalex.org/W4313036632', 'https://openalex.org/W4312971576', 'https://openalex.org/W6804566349', 'https://openalex.org/W2986615800', 'https://openalex.org/W2752796333', 'https://openalex.org/W6843813467', 'https://openalex.org/W6776218486', 'https://openalex.org/W2342277278', 'https://openalex.org/W4313021454', 'https://openalex.org/W2962849139', 'https://openalex.org/W6749625137', 'https://openalex.org/W6801810553', 'https://openalex.org/W2963799213', 'https://openalex.org/W2971074500', 'https://openalex.org/W4225598930', 'https://openalex.org/W4289785095', 'https://openalex.org/W2949671016', 'https://openalex.org/W3216237230', 'https://openalex.org/W4394671432', 'https://openalex.org/W4224035735', 'https://openalex.org/W2964078384', 'https://openalex.org/W3166396011', 'https://openalex.org/W3089425003', 'https://openalex.org/W4287802874', 'https://openalex.org/W3129576130', 'https://openalex.org/W4288099666', 'https://openalex.org/W4225432580', 'https://openalex.org/W4307475428', 'https://openalex.org/W4312911498', 'https://openalex.org/W4301206121', 'https://openalex.org/W4383682679', 'https://openalex.org/W4294959213', 'https://openalex.org/W4286225000', 'https://openalex.org/W4303440777', 'https://openalex.org/W4298187450', 'https://openalex.org/W4226125322', 'https://openalex.org/W3203511201']",2023-06-01

They are powerful tools to capture the non-linear dependency between adjacent pixels and outperform traditional methods on various benchmarks. On the contrary, research works investigating unsupervised PolSAR classification are quite rare, because most CNN models need to be trained with labeled data. In this paper, we propose a completely unsupervised model by fusing the Convolutional Autoencoder (CAE) with Vector Quantization (VQ). An auxiliary Gaussian smoothing loss is adopted for better semantic consistency in the output classification map. Qualitative and quantitative experiments are carried out on satellite and airborne full polarization data (RadarSat2/E-SAR, AIRSAR).

Nonetheless, the development of these biologics as therapeutics remains a challenge. Despite the availability of established in vitro directed evolution technologies that are relatively fast and cheap to deploy, the gold standard for generating therapeutic antibodies remains discovery from animal immunization or patients. Immune-system derived antibodies tend to have favourable properties in vivo, including long half-life, low reactivity with self-antigens, and low toxicity. Here, we present AbNatiV, a deep-learning tool for assessing the nativeness of antibodies and nanobodies, i.e., their likelihood of belonging to the distribution of immune-system derived human antibodies or camelid nanobodies. AbNatiV is a multi-purpose tool that accurately predicts the nativeness of Fv sequences from any source, including synthetic libraries and computational design. It provides an interpretable score that predicts the likelihood of immunogenicity, and a residue-level profile that can guide the engineering of antibodies and nanobodies indistinguishable from immune-system-derived ones. We further introduce an automated humanisation pipeline, which we applied to two nanobodies. Wet-lab experiments show that AbNatiV-humanized nanobodies retain binding and stability at par or better than their wild type, unlike nanobodies humanised relying on conventional structural and residue-frequency analysis. We make AbNatiV available as downloadable software and as a webserver.","['https://openalex.org/W1971715214', 'https://openalex.org/W3024676672', 'https://openalex.org/W4310875677', 'https://openalex.org/W2095553811', 'https://openalex.org/W2169610187', 'https://openalex.org/W2317056394', 'https://openalex.org/W1515836930', 'https://openalex.org/W2011261569', 'https://openalex.org/W2896148359', 'https://openalex.org/W4319842310', 'https://openalex.org/W2052332203', 'https://openalex.org/W2105521580', 'https://openalex.org/W2140674483', 'https://openalex.org/W1998383538', 'https://openalex.org/W2123708888', 'https://openalex.org/W2004714495', 'https://openalex.org/W2578029714', 'https://openalex.org/W2999958881', 'https://openalex.org/W2665805494', 'https://openalex.org/W1912933662', 'https://openalex.org/W4308915416', 'https://openalex.org/W2758496793', 'https://openalex.org/W2804969359', 'https://openalex.org/W3197623424', 'https://openalex.org/W4321748896', 'https://openalex.org/W4315619796', 'https://openalex.org/W2992583967', 'https://openalex.org/W3000377151', 'https://openalex.org/W4220959747', 'https://openalex.org/W4213244137', 'https://openalex.org/W2913847447', 'https://openalex.org/W3030808598', 'https://openalex.org/W2752796333', 'https://openalex.org/W3089425003', 'https://openalex.org/W2025768430', 'https://openalex.org/W3191938286', 'https://openalex.org/W3169434891', 'https://openalex.org/W3062976875', 'https://openalex.org/W2016690055', 'https://openalex.org/W2053319140', 'https://openalex.org/W1989053318', 'https://openalex.org/W2117292655', 'https://openalex.org/W4221053240', 'https://openalex.org/W2986725225', 'https://openalex.org/W3095441755', 'https://openalex.org/W2053222732', 'https://openalex.org/W1488587546', 'https://openalex.org/W4308220076', 'https://openalex.org/W2079576324', 'https://openalex.org/W3096751000', 'https://openalex.org/W2078070662', 'https://openalex.org/W3132323068', 'https://openalex.org/W2893755931', 'https://openalex.org/W2996962244', 'https://openalex.org/W3205114076', 'https://openalex.org/W3029308247', 'https://openalex.org/W3134185574', 'https://openalex.org/W3144239152', 'https://openalex.org/W4206087583', 'https://openalex.org/W2980789587', 'https://openalex.org/W4283744078', 'https://openalex.org/W4379919536', 'https://openalex.org/W2520345180', 'https://openalex.org/W2159047076', 'https://openalex.org/W3130039396', 'https://openalex.org/W1855237549', 'https://openalex.org/W6802517614', 'https://openalex.org/W6748381668', 'https://openalex.org/W2970971581', 'https://openalex.org/W3081874799', 'https://openalex.org/W3024610894', 'https://openalex.org/W2041741213', 'https://openalex.org/W2037914743', 'https://openalex.org/W2974982237', 'https://openalex.org/W2001900040', 'https://openalex.org/W2097356092', 'https://openalex.org/W2142808579', 'https://openalex.org/W1746465121', 'https://openalex.org/W4206948363']",2023-04-29

We are able to generate both abstractive summaries by decoding these frequent encodings, and extractive summaries by selecting the sentences assigned to the same frequent encodings. Our method is attributable, because the model identifies sentences used to generate the summary as part of the summarization process. It scales easily to many hundreds of input reviews, because aggregation is performed in the latent space rather than over long sequences of tokens. We also demonstrate that our appraoch enables a degree of control, generating aspect-specific summaries by restricting the model to parts of the encoding space that correspond to desired aspects (e.g., location or food). Automatic and human evaluation on two datasets from different domains demonstrates that our method generates summaries that are more informative than prior work and better grounded in the input reviews.","['https://openalex.org/W1700083040', 'https://openalex.org/W4285150129', 'https://openalex.org/W4205742210', 'https://openalex.org/W4380887855', 'https://openalex.org/W4297971002', 'https://openalex.org/W2160660844', 'https://openalex.org/W4226278401', 'https://openalex.org/W3034999214', 'https://openalex.org/W3170180819', 'https://openalex.org/W2594978815', 'https://openalex.org/W3206890901', 'https://openalex.org/W2963341956', 'https://openalex.org/W3089425003', 'https://openalex.org/W4285118796', 'https://openalex.org/W2963748441', 'https://openalex.org/W2144211451', 'https://openalex.org/W3035043191', 'https://openalex.org/W3186655327', 'https://openalex.org/W4226118367', 'https://openalex.org/W4287824654', 'https://openalex.org/W3173759686', 'https://openalex.org/W3198269165', 'https://openalex.org/W1939882552', 'https://openalex.org/W1522301498', 'https://openalex.org/W2983771799', 'https://openalex.org/W2971074500', 'https://openalex.org/W2913407944', 'https://openalex.org/W4205169447', 'https://openalex.org/W2154652894', 'https://openalex.org/W1959608418', 'https://openalex.org/W2963799213', 'https://openalex.org/W2963721761', 'https://openalex.org/W2119913432', 'https://openalex.org/W3173655578', 'https://openalex.org/W2548228487', 'https://openalex.org/W4226157795', 'https://openalex.org/W3215615641', 'https://openalex.org/W4229907684', 'https://openalex.org/W4385245566', 'https://openalex.org/W2110693578', 'https://openalex.org/W3153621364', 'https://openalex.org/W3213990450', 'https://openalex.org/W3191640844', 'https://openalex.org/W2547875792']",2023-01-01

The latent space of sequence-to-structure prediction models such as ESMFold represents the joint distribution of sequence and structure; however, we find these embeddings to exhibit massive activations, whereby some channels have values 3000× higher than others, regardless of the input. Further, on continuous compression schemes, ESMFold embeddings can be reduced by a factor of 128× along the channel and 8× along the length, while retaining structure information at &lt;2Å scale accuracy, and performing competitively on protein function and localization benchmarks. On discrete compression schemes, we construct a tokenized all-atom structure vocabulary that retains high reconstruction accuracy, thus introducing a tokenized representation of all-atom structure that can be obtained from sequence alone . We term this series of embeddings as CHEAP (Compressed Hourglass Embedding Adaptations of Proteins) embeddings, obtained via the HPCT (Hourglass Protein Compression Transformer) architecture. CHEAP is a compact representation of both protein structure and sequence, sheds light on information content asymmetries between sequence and structure, democratizes representations captured by large models, and is designed to have flexible downstream applications such as generation, search, and prediction.","['https://openalex.org/W2242818861', 'https://openalex.org/W2130479394', 'https://openalex.org/W3195577433', 'https://openalex.org/W4313021454', 'https://openalex.org/W4296032638', 'https://openalex.org/W3177500196', 'https://openalex.org/W3180355996', 'https://openalex.org/W4399114836', 'https://openalex.org/W4400231442', 'https://openalex.org/W2194775991', 'https://openalex.org/W3211983881', 'https://openalex.org/W4280491725', 'https://openalex.org/W3036167779', 'https://openalex.org/W4223581484', 'https://openalex.org/W4376654479', 'https://openalex.org/W3177828909', 'https://openalex.org/W3089425003', 'https://openalex.org/W4327550249', 'https://openalex.org/W4387158294', 'https://openalex.org/W3095583226', 'https://openalex.org/W3209873929', 'https://openalex.org/W4399115900', 'https://openalex.org/W2947590261', 'https://openalex.org/W4312933868', 'https://openalex.org/W2118265845', 'https://openalex.org/W4281485151', 'https://openalex.org/W3106745904', 'https://openalex.org/W3092442149', 'https://openalex.org/W4392271820', 'https://openalex.org/W2102461176', 'https://openalex.org/W4280528743', 'https://openalex.org/W4320855461', 'https://openalex.org/W2752796333', 'https://openalex.org/W4210840673', 'https://openalex.org/W4392381140', 'https://openalex.org/W4281719345']",2024-08-08

However, the conventional used continual latent variables in CVAE are more likely to generate generic rather than distinct and specific responses. To resolve this problem, we introduce a novel discrete variable called prior context which enables the generation of favorable responses. Specifically, we present Prior Context VAE (PCVAE), a hierarchical VAE that learns prior context from data automatically for dialogue generation. Meanwhile, we design Active Codeword Transport (ACT) to help the model actively discover potential prior context. Moreover, we propose Autoregressive Compatible Arrangement (ACA) that enables modeling prior context in autoregressive style, which is crucial for selecting appropriate prior context according to a given context. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PCVAE can generate distinct responses and significantly outperforms strong baselines.","['https://openalex.org/W2811079561', 'https://openalex.org/W2963411289', 'https://openalex.org/W3089425003', 'https://openalex.org/W2133564696', 'https://openalex.org/W2251023345', 'https://openalex.org/W2242818861', 'https://openalex.org/W2963799213', 'https://openalex.org/W4394662461', 'https://openalex.org/W3045703328', 'https://openalex.org/W2123301721', 'https://openalex.org/W2971199636', 'https://openalex.org/W1902237438', 'https://openalex.org/W2962717182', 'https://openalex.org/W1521626219', 'https://openalex.org/W2951883832', 'https://openalex.org/W2188365844', 'https://openalex.org/W1959608418', 'https://openalex.org/W2807791032', 'https://openalex.org/W3175460367', 'https://openalex.org/W2250539671', 'https://openalex.org/W2125320996', 'https://openalex.org/W2963206148', 'https://openalex.org/W2963567641', 'https://openalex.org/W2157331557', 'https://openalex.org/W3035044096', 'https://openalex.org/W4287802874', 'https://openalex.org/W2997955173', 'https://openalex.org/W2950142196', 'https://openalex.org/W2158131535', 'https://openalex.org/W1518951372']",2022-07-01

While phase-aware speech enhancement methods using the complex ideal ratio mask (cIRM) have shown promise, the estimation difficulty of the phase is shared with the real and imaginary parts of the cIRM. The pattern lacking in the imaginary part poses particular difficulties. To address this issue, we proposed a phase-aware speech enhancement method that uses a complex Wiener filter, which delegates the estimation of speech and noise amplitude properties and the phase property to different models, mitigating the issues with the cIRM and improving the effectiveness of neural-network training. Our method uses a speech-variance estimation model with a noise-robust vector-quantized variational autoencoder and a phase corrector that maximizes the scale-invariant signal-to-noise ratio in the time domain. To further improve speech-variance estimation, we propose a loss function that uses a categorical distribution of fundamental frequency (F0) for enhancing the spectral fine structure of estimated speech variance. We evaluated our method on the open dataset released by Valentini et al. to directly compare it with other speech-enhancement methods. Our method achieved a perceptual evaluation of speech quality score of 2.86 and short-time objective intelligibility score of 0.94, better than the state-of-the-art method based on cIRM estimation during the 2020 Deep Noise Challenge. Our comprehensive analysis shows that incorporating the proposed loss function for spectral-fine-structure enhancement improves speech quality, especially when the F0 is low.","['https://openalex.org/W2128653836', 'https://openalex.org/W2113131123', 'https://openalex.org/W3147539069', 'https://openalex.org/W2013590534', 'https://openalex.org/W2963341071', 'https://openalex.org/W2952218014', 'https://openalex.org/W6798721538', 'https://openalex.org/W2044893557', 'https://openalex.org/W160800111', 'https://openalex.org/W190004713', 'https://openalex.org/W2405774341', 'https://openalex.org/W2790760353', 'https://openalex.org/W3092864146', 'https://openalex.org/W2027840501', 'https://openalex.org/W2766672686', 'https://openalex.org/W2883322837', 'https://openalex.org/W3131332223', 'https://openalex.org/W6640963894', 'https://openalex.org/W2039844283', 'https://openalex.org/W2070126272', 'https://openalex.org/W3097312999', 'https://openalex.org/W3045520545', 'https://openalex.org/W3096408984', 'https://openalex.org/W3160085755', 'https://openalex.org/W3095057960', 'https://openalex.org/W3198680319', 'https://openalex.org/W2291877678', 'https://openalex.org/W6738884980', 'https://openalex.org/W6757632829', 'https://openalex.org/W3135915893', 'https://openalex.org/W4297841734', 'https://openalex.org/W2752796333', 'https://openalex.org/W2514828952', 'https://openalex.org/W3100270690', 'https://openalex.org/W2022554507', 'https://openalex.org/W4225298533', 'https://openalex.org/W6729448088', 'https://openalex.org/W2094721231', 'https://openalex.org/W4232282348', 'https://openalex.org/W3199367817', 'https://openalex.org/W3120336970', 'https://openalex.org/W3089425003', 'https://openalex.org/W1552314771', 'https://openalex.org/W2067295501', 'https://openalex.org/W2802304149', 'https://openalex.org/W6751512325', 'https://openalex.org/W6762114000', 'https://openalex.org/W3081955528', 'https://openalex.org/W3117879684', 'https://openalex.org/W2889597349', 'https://openalex.org/W2963452667', 'https://openalex.org/W2949756029', 'https://openalex.org/W3099330747']",2023-01-01

A promising new direction for the field is training gait recognition systems without explicit human annotations, through self-supervised learning approaches. Such methods are heavily reliant on strong augmentations for the same walking sequence to induce more data variability and to simulate additional walking variations. Current data augmentation schemes are heuristic and cannot provide the necessary data variation as they are only able to provide simple temporal and spatial distortions. In this work, we propose GaitMorph, a novel method to modify the walking variation for an input gait sequence. Our method entails the training of a high-compression model for gait skeleton sequences that leverages unlabelled data to construct a discrete and interpretable latent space, which preserves identity-related features. Furthermore, we propose a method based on optimal transport theory to learn latent transport maps on the discrete codebook that morph gait sequences between variations. We perform extensive experiments and show that our method is suitable to synthesize additional views for an input sequence.","['https://openalex.org/W3042230461', 'https://openalex.org/W2029241756', 'https://openalex.org/W4214722801', 'https://openalex.org/W3128064349', 'https://openalex.org/W6774314701', 'https://openalex.org/W4319298095', 'https://openalex.org/W4322743576', 'https://openalex.org/W4295215046', 'https://openalex.org/W2078179989', 'https://openalex.org/W3180355996', 'https://openalex.org/W4205268692', 'https://openalex.org/W6795007937', 'https://openalex.org/W2924334974', 'https://openalex.org/W1536680647', 'https://openalex.org/W4200634815', 'https://openalex.org/W4319299814', 'https://openalex.org/W3158576998', 'https://openalex.org/W4206286792', 'https://openalex.org/W6755977528', 'https://openalex.org/W6765779288', 'https://openalex.org/W3114632476', 'https://openalex.org/W3214185843', 'https://openalex.org/W6631190155', 'https://openalex.org/W3089425003', 'https://openalex.org/W4214538268', 'https://openalex.org/W4304080803', 'https://openalex.org/W6841592900', 'https://openalex.org/W4312674262', 'https://openalex.org/W3035225512', 'https://openalex.org/W4313056154', 'https://openalex.org/W4287509562', 'https://openalex.org/W2983925976', 'https://openalex.org/W3153832461', 'https://openalex.org/W4297981470', 'https://openalex.org/W6849932897', 'https://openalex.org/W6762931180', 'https://openalex.org/W4295338723', 'https://openalex.org/W3204207201', 'https://openalex.org/W2948058585', 'https://openalex.org/W6810831447', 'https://openalex.org/W4312671789', 'https://openalex.org/W6639794760', 'https://openalex.org/W6686164453', 'https://openalex.org/W3195852174', 'https://openalex.org/W4313145975', 'https://openalex.org/W6777179611', 'https://openalex.org/W2752796333', 'https://openalex.org/W4233762729', 'https://openalex.org/W3110190397', 'https://openalex.org/W4312612133', 'https://openalex.org/W3187415662', 'https://openalex.org/W2983796203', 'https://openalex.org/W2963076818', 'https://openalex.org/W2998792609', 'https://openalex.org/W6802517614', 'https://openalex.org/W2739325416', 'https://openalex.org/W2104335344', 'https://openalex.org/W3215615641', 'https://openalex.org/W4386076288', 'https://openalex.org/W6849682310', 'https://openalex.org/W6781523853', 'https://openalex.org/W2963854019', 'https://openalex.org/W4312652114', 'https://openalex.org/W4214564952', 'https://openalex.org/W2183341477', 'https://openalex.org/W4320853786', 'https://openalex.org/W2971074500', 'https://openalex.org/W4287245321', 'https://openalex.org/W3206395542', 'https://openalex.org/W4289785378', 'https://openalex.org/W2963799213', 'https://openalex.org/W4320085220', 'https://openalex.org/W3125736290', 'https://openalex.org/W4301206121', 'https://openalex.org/W1904924995', 'https://openalex.org/W3005680577', 'https://openalex.org/W1522301498', 'https://openalex.org/W3026092005', 'https://openalex.org/W2899663614', 'https://openalex.org/W3046205681']",2023-09-25

Our method involves repairing a single degraded input image using a high-quality reference image. We utilize a texture extraction and distribution framework to transfer high-quality texture features between the degraded input and reference image. However, the StyleGAN-like architecture in our framework requires high-quality latent codes to generate realistic images. The latent code extracted from the degraded input image often contains corrupted features, making it difficult to align the semantic information from the input with the high-quality textures from the reference. To overcome this challenge, we employ two special techniques. The first technique, inspired by vector quantization, replaces corrupted semantic features with high-quality code words. The second technique generates style codes that carry photorealistic texture information from a more informative latent space developed using the high-quality features in the reference image's manifold. Extensive experiments conducted on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that our method produces results with more realistic contextual details and outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

However, the development of generative modeling techniques for paraphrase generation still lags behind largely due to the challenges in addressing the complex conflicts between expression diversity and semantic preservation. This paper proposes to generate diverse and high-quality paraphrases by exploiting the pre-trained models with instance-dependent prompts. To learn generalizable prompts, we assume that the number of abstract transforming patterns of paraphrase generation (governed by prompts) is finite and usually not large.

Enhancing user experience demands agents that are capable of displaying realistic affective and social behaviors within these systems, and, as a prerequisite, with the capability of understanding their interaction partner and responding appropriately. Based on our literature review of recent works published in the field of co-speech gesture generation, researchers have developed complex models capable of generating gestures characterized by a high level of human-likeness and speaker appropriateness. Nevertheless, this is only true in settings where the agent has an active status (i.e., the agent acts as the speaker), or it is delivering a monologue in a non-interactive setting. However, as illustrated in multiple works and competitions like the GENEA Challenge, these models remain inadequate in generating interlocutor-aware gestures. We consider interlocutor-aware gesture generation the process of displaying gestures that take into account the conversation partner’s behavior. Moreover, in settings where the agent is the listener, generated gestures lack the level of naturalness that we expect from a face-to-face conversation. To overcome these issues, we have designed a pipeline, called TAG2G, composed of a diffusion model, which was demonstrated to be a stable and powerful tool in gesture generation, and a vector-quantized variational auto-encoder (VQVAE), widely employed to produce meaningful gesture embeddings. Refocusing from monadic to dyadic multimodal input settings (i.e., taking into account text, audio, and previous gestures of both participants of a conversation) allows us to explore and infer the complex interaction mechanisms that lie in a balanced two-sided conversation. As per our results, a multi-agent conversational input setup improves the generated gestures’ appropriateness with respect to the conversational counterparts. Conversely, when the agent is speaking, a monadic approach performs better in terms of the generated gestures’ appropriateness in relation to the speech.","['https://openalex.org/W4364377334', 'https://openalex.org/W2903438696', 'https://openalex.org/W6735044664', 'https://openalex.org/W3119399459', 'https://openalex.org/W4387421378', 'https://openalex.org/W3132983845', 'https://openalex.org/W2008208299', 'https://openalex.org/W1575301740', 'https://openalex.org/W2135431835', 'https://openalex.org/W4221142137', 'https://openalex.org/W3133090439', 'https://openalex.org/W4292945985', 'https://openalex.org/W1208039178', 'https://openalex.org/W4312719027', 'https://openalex.org/W3209984917', 'https://openalex.org/W3209059054', 'https://openalex.org/W2780932362', 'https://openalex.org/W4312309978', 'https://openalex.org/W4312437946', 'https://openalex.org/W4387423983', 'https://openalex.org/W4298128030', 'https://openalex.org/W4285981714', 'https://openalex.org/W4385764101', 'https://openalex.org/W4386755513', 'https://openalex.org/W2022214202', 'https://openalex.org/W4389274031', 'https://openalex.org/W4387446259', 'https://openalex.org/W4387968147', 'https://openalex.org/W3083173864', 'https://openalex.org/W2752796333', 'https://openalex.org/W3089425003', 'https://openalex.org/W6779823529', 'https://openalex.org/W4388979610', 'https://openalex.org/W4287509562', 'https://openalex.org/W3204559413', 'https://openalex.org/W203345490', 'https://openalex.org/W3153551559', 'https://openalex.org/W3036167779', 'https://openalex.org/W2598745374', 'https://openalex.org/W3125775899']",2024-08-24

The agility of pulse parameters makes it difficult to recognize their behavior states. Currently, most of the existing approaches for recognizing MFR behaviors heavily depend on prior information, which can hardly be obtained in a noncooperative way. This study develops a contrastive self-supervised method to adaptively segment and cluster MFR pulse sequences into radar words with little prior information. First, a convolutional neural network (CNN) is trained in a self-supervised manner to differentiate between adjacent and nonadjacent pulse group embeddings to learn robust feature representations from sequences of pulse descriptor words (PDWs). Next, based on the learned embeddings, test statistics are calculated for each PDW sequence to detect change points, which are, in turn, used to segment the sequence into multiple subsegments, each containing only one radar word. Finally, feature vectors are produced for clustering the subsegments into groups of radar words. Simulation results show that without using any labeled data, the proposed method can effectively extract the radar words of a hypothetical MFR under corrupted and overlapped pulse parameters and performs only slightly worse than the state-of-the-art fully supervised method.","['https://openalex.org/W1977782550', 'https://openalex.org/W2108777121', 'https://openalex.org/W2768783378', 'https://openalex.org/W6677224193', 'https://openalex.org/W3005701803', 'https://openalex.org/W2295032983', 'https://openalex.org/W3130749205', 'https://openalex.org/W2113592174', 'https://openalex.org/W6630754547', 'https://openalex.org/W3007858997', 'https://openalex.org/W3107981615', 'https://openalex.org/W3021364482', 'https://openalex.org/W3161492984', 'https://openalex.org/W3173837271', 'https://openalex.org/W3034171073', 'https://openalex.org/W3164071761', 'https://openalex.org/W3023371261', 'https://openalex.org/W3110446398', 'https://openalex.org/W3114632476', 'https://openalex.org/W3096656254', 'https://openalex.org/W2947445680', 'https://openalex.org/W1531268951', 'https://openalex.org/W6682948231', 'https://openalex.org/W1498436455', 'https://openalex.org/W6774314701', 'https://openalex.org/W6668990524', 'https://openalex.org/W2949488362', 'https://openalex.org/W1987971958', 'https://openalex.org/W2599882013', 'https://openalex.org/W3013889479', 'https://openalex.org/W6766978945', 'https://openalex.org/W6631190155', 'https://openalex.org/W6746904271', 'https://openalex.org/W6844194202', 'https://openalex.org/W130754613', 'https://openalex.org/W2649995573', 'https://openalex.org/W6683161245', 'https://openalex.org/W2744335156', 'https://openalex.org/W2509841691', 'https://openalex.org/W1673567634', 'https://openalex.org/W1975684011', 'https://openalex.org/W4235169531', 'https://openalex.org/W1511910497', 'https://openalex.org/W2073459066', 'https://openalex.org/W2115790511', 'https://openalex.org/W4297808394', 'https://openalex.org/W2775127214']",2023-10-13

However, the current style voice conversion approach relies on pre-defined labels or reference speech to control the conversion process, which leads to limitations in style diversity or falls short in terms of the intuitive and interpretability of style representation. In this study, we propose PromptVC, a novel style voice conversion approach that employs a latent diffusion model to generate a style vector driven by natural language prompts. Specifically, the style vector is extracted by a style encoder during training, and then the latent diffusion model is trained independently to sample the style vector from noise, with this process being conditioned on natural language prompts. To improve style expressiveness, we leverage HuBERT to extract discrete tokens and replace them with the K-Means center embedding to serve as the linguistic content, which minimizes residual style information. Additionally, we deduplicate the same discrete token and employ a differentiable duration predictor to re-predict the duration of each token, which can adapt the duration of the same linguistic content to different styles. The subjective and objective evaluation results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed system.","['https://openalex.org/W3098557217', 'https://openalex.org/W4372260214', 'https://openalex.org/W4283689139', 'https://openalex.org/W4372267192', 'https://openalex.org/W4205742757', 'https://openalex.org/W3096939667', 'https://openalex.org/W2947445680', 'https://openalex.org/W2938833595', 'https://openalex.org/W4372260157', 'https://openalex.org/W3163573274', 'https://openalex.org/W4225264140', 'https://openalex.org/W3216296943', 'https://openalex.org/W6750489868', 'https://openalex.org/W4226474318', 'https://openalex.org/W4398152753', 'https://openalex.org/W4385822787', 'https://openalex.org/W4375869257', 'https://openalex.org/W3209059054', 'https://openalex.org/W6795807602', 'https://openalex.org/W2519091744', 'https://openalex.org/W6763832098', 'https://openalex.org/W6778823374', 'https://openalex.org/W6796464841', 'https://openalex.org/W4312933868', 'https://openalex.org/W2107860279', 'https://openalex.org/W2067295501', 'https://openalex.org/W1574447377']",2024-03-18

As recent VC techniques have made significant progress, implementing them in real-world scenarios is also considered, where speech data have some inevitable interferences, the most common of which are background sounds. On the other hand, background sounds are informative and need to be retained in some applications, such as VC in movies/videos. To address these issues, we have proposed a noisy-to-noisy (N2N) VC framework that does not rely on clean VC data and models the noisy speech directly by using noise as conditions. Previous experimental results have proven its effectiveness. In this article, we further improve its performance by introducing the pre-trained noise-conditioned VC model. Moreover, to further explore the impacts of introducing noise conditions, the performance in more realistic situations is evaluated in which the training set possesses speaker-dependent noisy conditions. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the pre-training strategy and the degradation of its performance under strict noisy conditions. We then proposed a noise augmentation method to overcome the limitation.

In this work, we train a speech conversion model for multiple domains rather than a specific source and target domain pair, and we generate diverse output speech signals from a given source domain speech by transferring some speech style-related characteristics while preserving its linguistic content information. The proposed method comprises a variational autoencoder (VAE)-based many-to-many speech conversion network with a Wasserstein generative adversarial network (WGAN) and a skip-connected autoencoder-based self-supervised learning network. The proposed conversion network trains the models by decomposing the spectral features of the input speech signal into a content factor that represents domain-invariant information and a style factor that represents domain-related information to automatically estimate the various speech styles of each domain, and the network converts the input speech signal to another domain using the computed content factor with the target style factor we want to change. Diverse and multimodal outputs can be generated by sampling different style factors. We also train models in a stable manner and improve the quality of generated outputs by sharing the discriminator of the VAE-based speech conversion network and that of the self-supervised learning network. We apply the proposed method to speaker conversion and perform the perceptual evaluations. Experimental results revealed that the proposed method obtained high accuracy of converted spectra, significantly improved the sound quality and speaker similarity of the converted speech, and contributed to stable model training.","['https://openalex.org/W2936774411', 'https://openalex.org/W2962780374', 'https://openalex.org/W2515028311', 'https://openalex.org/W6745535286', 'https://openalex.org/W6741832134', 'https://openalex.org/W2963035245', 'https://openalex.org/W6917638038', 'https://openalex.org/W2120605154', 'https://openalex.org/W2603777577', 'https://openalex.org/W1974843131', 'https://openalex.org/W2532494225', 'https://openalex.org/W6745117592', 'https://openalex.org/W2804998325', 'https://openalex.org/W2972544500', 'https://openalex.org/W2963539064', 'https://openalex.org/W2962793481', 'https://openalex.org/W2963073614', 'https://openalex.org/W2962896155', 'https://openalex.org/W6756002706', 'https://openalex.org/W2806000759', 'https://openalex.org/W4245885054', 'https://openalex.org/W2947445680', 'https://openalex.org/W2142300631', 'https://openalex.org/W2067175291', 'https://openalex.org/W2576309025', 'https://openalex.org/W2515020857', 'https://openalex.org/W2056852181', 'https://openalex.org/W2017742648', 'https://openalex.org/W6687506355', 'https://openalex.org/W1590808459', 'https://openalex.org/W2963890275', 'https://openalex.org/W2962824366', 'https://openalex.org/W2953327099', 'https://openalex.org/W2973157397', 'https://openalex.org/W3015213852', 'https://openalex.org/W343636949', 'https://openalex.org/W6777232839', 'https://openalex.org/W3148040514', 'https://openalex.org/W2758785877', 'https://openalex.org/W2963618559', 'https://openalex.org/W4320013936', 'https://openalex.org/W2964167449', 'https://openalex.org/W2899361462', 'https://openalex.org/W2099471712', 'https://openalex.org/W3025035610', 'https://openalex.org/W2739748921', 'https://openalex.org/W3127686677', 'https://openalex.org/W2963746531']",2021-01-01
https://openalex.org/W4385569627,https://doi.org/10.1109/taslp.2023.3301212,Parallel Synthesis for Autoregressive Speech Generation,"Autoregressive neural vocoders have achieved outstanding performance and are widely used in speech synthesis tasks such as text-to-speech and voice conversion. An autoregressive vocoder predicts a sample at some time step conditioned on those at previous time steps. Though it can generate highly natural human speech, the iterative generation inevitably makes the synthesis time proportional to the utterance length, leading to low efficiency. Many works were dedicated to generating the whole speech time sequence in parallel and then proposed GAN-based, flow-based, and score-based vocoders. This paper proposed a new thought for the autoregressive generation. Instead of iteratively predicting samples in a time sequence, the proposed model performs frequency-wise autoregressive generation (FAR) and bit-wise autoregressive generation (BAR) to synthesize speech. In FAR, a speech utterance is first split into different frequency subbands. The proposed model generates a subband conditioned on the previously generated one. A full-band speech can then be reconstructed from these generated subbands. Similarly, in BAR, an 8-bit quantized signal is generated iteratively from the first bit. By redesigning the autoregressive method to compute in domains other than the time domain, the number of iterations in the proposed model is no longer proportional to the utterance's length but to the number of subbands/bits. The inference efficiency is hence significantly increased. Besides, a post-filter is employed to sample audio signals from output posteriors, and its training objective is designed based on the characteristics of the proposed autoregressive methods. The experimental results show that the proposed model can synthesize speech faster than real-time without GPU acceleration. Compared with the baseline autoregressive and non-autoregressive vocoders, the proposed model achieves better MUSHRA results and shows good generalization ability while synthesizing 44 kHz speech or utterances from unseen speakers.","['https://openalex.org/W2120847449', 'https://openalex.org/W2148770129', 'https://openalex.org/W2598638573', 'https://openalex.org/W2143280761', 'https://openalex.org/W2885820941', 'https://openalex.org/W6733471323', 'https://openalex.org/W2963830550', 'https://openalex.org/W1494895475', 'https://openalex.org/W6774645763', 'https://openalex.org/W6839643428', 'https://openalex.org/W6711777497', 'https://openalex.org/W2118806033', 'https://openalex.org/W2471520273', 'https://openalex.org/W3144035034', 'https://openalex.org/W3161704465', 'https://openalex.org/W2947445680', 'https://openalex.org/W2784918340', 'https://openalex.org/W6762533536', 'https://openalex.org/W4231807801', 'https://openalex.org/W2423557781', 'https://openalex.org/W4283817920', 'https://openalex.org/W6943912960', 'https://openalex.org/W6781251213', 'https://openalex.org/W3141224548', 'https://openalex.org/W2963542120', 'https://openalex.org/W6778883912', 'https://openalex.org/W6739901393', 'https://openalex.org/W6782760101', 'https://openalex.org/W6783867762', 'https://openalex.org/W2118774185', 'https://openalex.org/W3097895838', 'https://openalex.org/W2996797022', 'https://openalex.org/W6783182287', 'https://openalex.org/W2963654953', 'https://openalex.org/W3034999214', 'https://openalex.org/W2111284386', 'https://openalex.org/W2102003408', 'https://openalex.org/W6748409065', 'https://openalex.org/W6776390925', 'https://openalex.org/W2964243274', 'https://openalex.org/W2963609956', 'https://openalex.org/W3097828251', 'https://openalex.org/W6767111847', 'https://openalex.org/W2107860279', 'https://openalex.org/W6773094808', 'https://openalex.org/W6631190155', 'https://openalex.org/W3015338123', 'https://openalex.org/W6603838645', 'https://openalex.org/W6843673214', 'https://openalex.org/W2963300588', 'https://openalex.org/W6753855596', 'https://openalex.org/W3096702751', 'https://openalex.org/W2888169323', 'https://openalex.org/W3097538987', 'https://openalex.org/W2964041258', 'https://openalex.org/W3095459301', 'https://openalex.org/W6917585676', 'https://openalex.org/W3095419383', 'https://openalex.org/W6786325012', 'https://openalex.org/W6778823374', 'https://openalex.org/W3197294703', 'https://openalex.org/W6771024825', 'https://openalex.org/W6756159577', 'https://openalex.org/W6766837696', 'https://openalex.org/W2963103134', 'https://openalex.org/W2805217154', 'https://openalex.org/W1521637132', 'https://openalex.org/W3162770051', 'https://openalex.org/W2172065531', 'https://openalex.org/W6771719367', 'https://openalex.org/W6802838302', 'https://openalex.org/W3095851005', 'https://openalex.org/W2890983311', 'https://openalex.org/W3100270690', 'https://openalex.org/W3163662330', 'https://openalex.org/W4377079846', 'https://openalex.org/W3154504973', 'https://openalex.org/W2954386831', 'https://openalex.org/W2889606145', 'https://openalex.org/W3140429000', 'https://openalex.org/W3034363136', 'https://openalex.org/W2785516183', 'https://openalex.org/W2963091184', 'https://openalex.org/W2912237252', 'https://openalex.org/W6752910514', 'https://openalex.org/W2963434219', 'https://openalex.org/W6746208923', 'https://openalex.org/W2969937244', 'https://openalex.org/W4294619240', 'https://openalex.org/W2970006822', 'https://openalex.org/W2999160446', 'https://openalex.org/W4287694050', 'https://openalex.org/W3122318757', 'https://openalex.org/W4292779060', 'https://openalex.org/W4283388932', 'https://openalex.org/W4385245566', 'https://openalex.org/W2587284713', 'https://openalex.org/W3008758407', 'https://openalex.org/W2945478979', 'https://openalex.org/W4298580827', 'https://openalex.org/W3105124182', 'https://openalex.org/W3033411150', 'https://openalex.org/W2519091744', 'https://openalex.org/W3109064156', 'https://openalex.org/W3103913581', 'https://openalex.org/W4289305009', 'https://openalex.org/W2953318193', 'https://openalex.org/W4225304461', 'https://openalex.org/W2963975282', 'https://openalex.org/W2993118648', 'https://openalex.org/W3034794073', 'https://openalex.org/W3123097577', 'https://openalex.org/W4320013936', 'https://openalex.org/W4289761690', 'https://openalex.org/W3092028330', 'https://openalex.org/W3129651364', 'https://openalex.org/W2994373303', 'https://openalex.org/W2767206889', 'https://openalex.org/W2395578248', 'https://openalex.org/W95152782', 'https://openalex.org/W1522301498', 'https://openalex.org/W4286899907']",2023-01-01
https://openalex.org/W4206192208,https://doi.org/10.36227/techrxiv.17976062,Towards Self-supervised Learning for Multi-function Radar Behavior State Detection and Recognition,"&lt;div&gt;The analysis of intercepted multi-function radar (MFR) signals has gained considerable attention in the field of cognitive electronic reconnaissance. With the rapid development of MFR, the switch between different work modes is becoming more flexible, increasing the agility of pulse parameters. Most of the existing approaches for recognizing MFR behaviors heavily depend on prior information, which can hardly be obtained in a non-cooperative way. This study develops a novel hierarchical contrastive self-supervise-based method for segmenting and clustering MFR pulse sequences. First, a convolutional neural network (CNN) with a limited receptive field is trained in a contrastive way to distinguish between pulse descriptor words (PDW) in the original order and the samples created by random permutations to detect the boundary between each radar word and perform segmentation. Afterward, the K-means++ algorithm with cosine distances is established to cluster the segmented PDWs according to the output vectors of the CNN’s last layer for radar words extraction. This segmenting and clustering process continues to go in the extracted radar word sequence, radar phase sequence, and so on, finishing the automatic extraction of MFR behavior states in the MFR hierarchical model. Simulation results show that without using any labeled data, the proposed method can effectively mine distinguishable patterns in the sequentially arriving PDWs and recognize the MFR behavior states under corrupted, overlapped pulse parameters.&lt;/div&gt;","['https://openalex.org/W2896457183', 'https://openalex.org/W3173837271', 'https://openalex.org/W3161492984', 'https://openalex.org/W4295312788', 'https://openalex.org/W3007858997', 'https://openalex.org/W2152790380', 'https://openalex.org/W130754613', 'https://openalex.org/W1498436455', 'https://openalex.org/W1511910497', 'https://openalex.org/W2076337359', 'https://openalex.org/W4304111904', 'https://openalex.org/W1987971958', 'https://openalex.org/W3096656254', 'https://openalex.org/W1614298861', 'https://openalex.org/W2113592174', 'https://openalex.org/W2947445680', 'https://openalex.org/W2973049979', 'https://openalex.org/W3021364482', 'https://openalex.org/W3013889479', 'https://openalex.org/W3034171073', 'https://openalex.org/W2949488362', 'https://openalex.org/W3023371261', 'https://openalex.org/W3107981615', 'https://openalex.org/W2073459066', 'https://openalex.org/W4297744580', 'https://openalex.org/W1977782550', 'https://openalex.org/W2886082382', 'https://openalex.org/W2962739339', 'https://openalex.org/W2157444450', 'https://openalex.org/W2115790511', 'https://openalex.org/W2997791733', 'https://openalex.org/W3110446398', 'https://openalex.org/W2599882013', 'https://openalex.org/W2768783378', 'https://openalex.org/W2108777121', 'https://openalex.org/W1531268951', 'https://openalex.org/W3164071761']",2022-01-11

First, we improve the structure of generator with TransNets to make full use of hierarchical features associated with speech naturalness. In TransNets, many shortcut connections share hierarchical features between encoding and decoding part to capture sufficient linguistic and semantic information, which helps to provide natural sounding converted speech and accelerate the convergence of training process. Second, by incorporating AdaIN for style transfer, we enable the generator to learn sufficient speaker characteristic information directly from speech instead of using attribute labels, which also provides a promising framework for one-shot VC. Objective and subjective experiments with nonparallel training data show that our method significantly outperforms StarGAN-VC in both speech naturalness and speaker similarity. The mean values of mean opinion score (MOS) and ABX are increased by 24.5% and 10.7%, respectively. The comparison of spectrogram also shows that our method can provide more complete harmonic structures and details, and effectively bridge the gap between converted speech and target speech.","['https://openalex.org/W2996797022', 'https://openalex.org/W2071431631', 'https://openalex.org/W3006824058', 'https://openalex.org/W2011378162', 'https://openalex.org/W2911494248', 'https://openalex.org/W2290946177', 'https://openalex.org/W2947445680', 'https://openalex.org/W2121095010', 'https://openalex.org/W2135832479', 'https://openalex.org/W2161476805', 'https://openalex.org/W2475998840', 'https://openalex.org/W2111550316', 'https://openalex.org/W2973135352', 'https://openalex.org/W2972544500', 'https://openalex.org/W3002433751', 'https://openalex.org/W2889061305', 'https://openalex.org/W2964069186', 'https://openalex.org/W2963539064', 'https://openalex.org/W2902070858', 'https://openalex.org/W2972667718', 'https://openalex.org/W2892734764', 'https://openalex.org/W2517513811', 'https://openalex.org/W2982444549', 'https://openalex.org/W2973127257', 'https://openalex.org/W2603777577', 'https://openalex.org/W2972452545', 'https://openalex.org/W2972659941', 'https://openalex.org/W2471520273', 'https://openalex.org/W2123771434', 'https://openalex.org/W2972399707', 'https://openalex.org/W3102628737', 'https://openalex.org/W3105124182', 'https://openalex.org/W3100378519', 'https://openalex.org/W2898832121']",2020-12-24
https://openalex.org/W3042203388,,Policy learning with partial observation and mechanical constraints for multi-person modeling,"Extracting the rules of real-world biological multi-agent behaviors is a current challenge in various scientific and engineering fields. Biological agents generally have limited observation and mechanical constraints; however, most of the conventional data-driven models ignore such assumptions, resulting in lack of biological plausibility and model interpretability for behavioral analyses in biological and cognitive science. Here we propose sequential generative models with partial observation and mechanical constraints, which can visualize whose information the agents utilize and can generate biologically plausible actions. We formulate this as a decentralized multi-agent imitation learning problem, leveraging binary partial observation models with a Gumbel-Softmax reparameterization and policy models based on hierarchical variational recurrent neural networks with physical and biomechanical constraints. We investigate the empirical performances using real-world multi-person motion datasets from basketball and soccer games.","['https://openalex.org/W2950950272', 'https://openalex.org/W2885318751', 'https://openalex.org/W2143969246', 'https://openalex.org/W2016589492', 'https://openalex.org/W2963166838', 'https://openalex.org/W2970116586', 'https://openalex.org/W2962957031', 'https://openalex.org/W2962715980', 'https://openalex.org/W2963562809', 'https://openalex.org/W2962695963', 'https://openalex.org/W2964121744', 'https://openalex.org/W2168359464', 'https://openalex.org/W2963062607', 'https://openalex.org/W2464234964', 'https://openalex.org/W2991489433', 'https://openalex.org/W2548228487', 'https://openalex.org/W2963717208', 'https://openalex.org/W2962947707', 'https://openalex.org/W2167052694', 'https://openalex.org/W2601465345', 'https://openalex.org/W2424778531', 'https://openalex.org/W1959608418', 'https://openalex.org/W2553756201', 'https://openalex.org/W2963464736', 'https://openalex.org/W2405096793', 'https://openalex.org/W2963279312', 'https://openalex.org/W2166302491', 'https://openalex.org/W2947445680', 'https://openalex.org/W2557519264', 'https://openalex.org/W2964308564', 'https://openalex.org/W2329185630', 'https://openalex.org/W2964199361', 'https://openalex.org/W2088956500', 'https://openalex.org/W2112164016', 'https://openalex.org/W2963091558', 'https://openalex.org/W2548815430', 'https://openalex.org/W2064675550', 'https://openalex.org/W2986244508', 'https://openalex.org/W2793483732', 'https://openalex.org/W2971179953', 'https://openalex.org/W2963755523', 'https://openalex.org/W2982202190', 'https://openalex.org/W2964339599', 'https://openalex.org/W2773355582', 'https://openalex.org/W2998212266', 'https://openalex.org/W2914524146', 'https://openalex.org/W3093010610', 'https://openalex.org/W592244745', 'https://openalex.org/W2998367975', 'https://openalex.org/W2905173465', 'https://openalex.org/W2949269657', 'https://openalex.org/W2962966033', 'https://openalex.org/W1985102978', 'https://openalex.org/W2982745079', 'https://openalex.org/W2963001155', 'https://openalex.org/W1885639605', 'https://openalex.org/W2915130814', 'https://openalex.org/W2064527819', 'https://openalex.org/W2896332777', 'https://openalex.org/W2971106883']",2020-07-07

Hypotheses about what is being learned by infants have traditionally driven researchers’ attempts to understand this surprising phenomenon. Here, we propose to start, instead, from hypotheses about how infants might learn. To implement this mechanism-driven approach, we introduce a quantitative modeling framework based on large-scale simulation of the learning process on realistic input. It allows learning mechanisms to be systematically linked to testable predictions regarding infants’ attunement to their native language(s). Through this framework, we obtain evidence for an account of infants’ attunement that challenges established theories about what infants are learning.","['https://openalex.org/W1994492508', 'https://openalex.org/W2062956221', 'https://openalex.org/W1985728169', 'https://openalex.org/W2037249514', 'https://openalex.org/W2095459173', 'https://openalex.org/W1968703923', 'https://openalex.org/W2140661818', 'https://openalex.org/W1564039035', 'https://openalex.org/W2803143571', 'https://openalex.org/W2911249026', 'https://openalex.org/W2063525438', 'https://openalex.org/W2142152793', 'https://openalex.org/W2113363891', 'https://openalex.org/W1925965306', 'https://openalex.org/W2184332496', 'https://openalex.org/W122673323', 'https://openalex.org/W2089883580', 'https://openalex.org/W2103091632', 'https://openalex.org/W2751798917', 'https://openalex.org/W2104752510', 'https://openalex.org/W2142633459', 'https://openalex.org/W2145810838', 'https://openalex.org/W2766298282', 'https://openalex.org/W2160464066', 'https://openalex.org/W1993755070', 'https://openalex.org/W111481704', 'https://openalex.org/W4300419953', 'https://openalex.org/W2095458199', 'https://openalex.org/W153534061', 'https://openalex.org/W2153767712', 'https://openalex.org/W2108145097', 'https://openalex.org/W2169991335', 'https://openalex.org/W1900890596', 'https://openalex.org/W2407869992', 'https://openalex.org/W2110627398', 'https://openalex.org/W2250874882', 'https://openalex.org/W2610616322', 'https://openalex.org/W2880673012', 'https://openalex.org/W2010188467', 'https://openalex.org/W1964201439', 'https://openalex.org/W2022042240', 'https://openalex.org/W2096563020', 'https://openalex.org/W135984148', 'https://openalex.org/W2117041980', 'https://openalex.org/W2114347655', 'https://openalex.org/W2100768664', 'https://openalex.org/W2025482506', 'https://openalex.org/W2052697931', 'https://openalex.org/W2786608204', 'https://openalex.org/W2346964103', 'https://openalex.org/W2347098582', 'https://openalex.org/W2399576818', 'https://openalex.org/W2404799143', 'https://openalex.org/W1545920196', 'https://openalex.org/W1796128977', 'https://openalex.org/W2400549570', 'https://openalex.org/W2345811097', 'https://openalex.org/W2787447541', 'https://openalex.org/W2758785877', 'https://openalex.org/W2963620343', 'https://openalex.org/W2483390977', 'https://openalex.org/W2980286501', 'https://openalex.org/W281094599', 'https://openalex.org/W2394503152', 'https://openalex.org/W1949377791', 'https://openalex.org/W2086880169', 'https://openalex.org/W1993049588', 'https://openalex.org/W2131070395', 'https://openalex.org/W2133514592', 'https://openalex.org/W2113153226', 'https://openalex.org/W2252142375', 'https://openalex.org/W2963648280', 'https://openalex.org/W2963234797', 'https://openalex.org/W2024490156', 'https://openalex.org/W66627554', 'https://openalex.org/W2145410271', 'https://openalex.org/W3034729383', 'https://openalex.org/W4234482113', 'https://openalex.org/W2146163948', 'https://openalex.org/W2395899413', 'https://openalex.org/W2593779438', 'https://openalex.org/W2157423901', 'https://openalex.org/W1995422333', 'https://openalex.org/W2001584575', 'https://openalex.org/W2182214061', 'https://openalex.org/W292738443', 'https://openalex.org/W2005311247', 'https://openalex.org/W2142124981', 'https://openalex.org/W2135563147', 'https://openalex.org/W2143022183', 'https://openalex.org/W2164203346', 'https://openalex.org/W2080079179', 'https://openalex.org/W2086022490', 'https://openalex.org/W2067039424', 'https://openalex.org/W2970859978', 'https://openalex.org/W2053819145', 'https://openalex.org/W1997141060', 'https://openalex.org/W1967974940', 'https://openalex.org/W1984549614', 'https://openalex.org/W2140014531', 'https://openalex.org/W3047822531', 'https://openalex.org/W2098363562', 'https://openalex.org/W2404952642', 'https://openalex.org/W2963137467', 'https://openalex.org/W2791647162', 'https://openalex.org/W2101509422', 'https://openalex.org/W1983870751', 'https://openalex.org/W2343593471', 'https://openalex.org/W2595479191', 'https://openalex.org/W2772732614', 'https://openalex.org/W6682569104', 'https://openalex.org/W2128032727', 'https://openalex.org/W2078993594', 'https://openalex.org/W2019575913', 'https://openalex.org/W2160719354', 'https://openalex.org/W1949929726', 'https://openalex.org/W4246559809', 'https://openalex.org/W4301823191', 'https://openalex.org/W1998662048', 'https://openalex.org/W2151967501', 'https://openalex.org/W3125709657', 'https://openalex.org/W3134136786', 'https://openalex.org/W2963618559', 'https://openalex.org/W598767079', 'https://openalex.org/W1985098633', 'https://openalex.org/W2082256905', 'https://openalex.org/W2164770604']",2021-01-28
https://openalex.org/W4230289889,https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/fc4wh,Early phonetic learning without phonetic categories -- Insights from large-scale simulations on realistic input,"Before they even speak, infants become attuned to the sounds of the language(s) they hear, processing native phonetic contrasts more easily than non-native ones. For example, between 6-8 months and 10-12 months, infants learning American English get better at distinguishing English [ɹ] and [l], as in ‘rock’ vs ‘lock’, relative to infants learning Japanese. Influential accounts of this early phonetic learning phenomenon initially proposed that infants group sounds into native vowel- and consonant-like phonetic categories—like [ɹ] and [l] in English—through a statistical clustering mechanism dubbed ‘distributional learning’. The feasibility of this mechanism for learning phonetic categories has been challenged, however. Here we demonstrate that a distributional learning algorithm operating on naturalistic speech can predict early phonetic learning as observed in Japanese and American English infants, suggesting that infants might learn through distributional learning after all. We further show, however, that contrary to the original distributional learning proposal, our model learns units too brief and too fine-grained acoustically to correspond to phonetic categories. This challenges the influential idea that what infants learn are phonetic categories. More broadly, our work introduces a novel mechanism-driven approach to the study of early phonetic learning, together with a quantitative modeling framework that can handle realistic input. This allows, for the first time, accounts of early phonetic learning to be linked to concrete, systematic predictions regarding infants’ attunement.","['https://openalex.org/W2345811097', 'https://openalex.org/W2133514592', 'https://openalex.org/W2096563020', 'https://openalex.org/W66627554', 'https://openalex.org/W2347098582', 'https://openalex.org/W2394503152', 'https://openalex.org/W3133848337', 'https://openalex.org/W2024490156', 'https://openalex.org/W2005311247', 'https://openalex.org/W2113153226', 'https://openalex.org/W1964201439', 'https://openalex.org/W1967974940', 'https://openalex.org/W2117041980', 'https://openalex.org/W3034729383', 'https://openalex.org/W2490706771', 'https://openalex.org/W4246559809', 'https://openalex.org/W2086880169', 'https://openalex.org/W4253947715', 'https://openalex.org/W4230637005', 'https://openalex.org/W2146163948', 'https://openalex.org/W2125624224', 'https://openalex.org/W2157423901', 'https://openalex.org/W2067039424', 'https://openalex.org/W2114347655', 'https://openalex.org/W1993049588', 'https://openalex.org/W2128032727', 'https://openalex.org/W2786608204', 'https://openalex.org/W2030196776', 'https://openalex.org/W2153767712', 'https://openalex.org/W3119948327', 'https://openalex.org/W1925965306', 'https://openalex.org/W2124789099', 'https://openalex.org/W3038687092', 'https://openalex.org/W2091143423', 'https://openalex.org/W2766298282', 'https://openalex.org/W2404952642', 'https://openalex.org/W2029008609', 'https://openalex.org/W281094599', 'https://openalex.org/W4299602607', 'https://openalex.org/W1900890596', 'https://openalex.org/W2142124981', 'https://openalex.org/W2086022490', 'https://openalex.org/W2142633459', 'https://openalex.org/W282666689', 'https://openalex.org/W2274405424', 'https://openalex.org/W2131070395', 'https://openalex.org/W2113363891', 'https://openalex.org/W2052697931', 'https://openalex.org/W2791647162', 'https://openalex.org/W2911249026', 'https://openalex.org/W2135535894', 'https://openalex.org/W2022042240', 'https://openalex.org/W2182214061', 'https://openalex.org/W2980286501', 'https://openalex.org/W2963234797', 'https://openalex.org/W2483390977', 'https://openalex.org/W2395899413', 'https://openalex.org/W2140014531', 'https://openalex.org/W1949377791', 'https://openalex.org/W111481704', 'https://openalex.org/W2171377672', 'https://openalex.org/W1564039035', 'https://openalex.org/W2000405415', 'https://openalex.org/W2162882125', 'https://openalex.org/W2160464066', 'https://openalex.org/W2151967501', 'https://openalex.org/W2751798917', 'https://openalex.org/W2169991335', 'https://openalex.org/W2110627398', 'https://openalex.org/W153534061', 'https://openalex.org/W1545920196', 'https://openalex.org/W2103091632', 'https://openalex.org/W1545077353', 'https://openalex.org/W2401877034', 'https://openalex.org/W2803143571', 'https://openalex.org/W2951066214', 'https://openalex.org/W2972967522', 'https://openalex.org/W1524333225', 'https://openalex.org/W2025482506', 'https://openalex.org/W2143437412', 'https://openalex.org/W2346964103', 'https://openalex.org/W2252142375', 'https://openalex.org/W2145410271', 'https://openalex.org/W2037720659', 'https://openalex.org/W1796128977', 'https://openalex.org/W3125709657', 'https://openalex.org/W2080079179', 'https://openalex.org/W2880673012', 'https://openalex.org/W1993755070', 'https://openalex.org/W2164203346', 'https://openalex.org/W2108145097', 'https://openalex.org/W2940544976', 'https://openalex.org/W2115646488', 'https://openalex.org/W2100768664', 'https://openalex.org/W2400549570', 'https://openalex.org/W2787447541', 'https://openalex.org/W2016200089', 'https://openalex.org/W2581714092', 'https://openalex.org/W2095458199', 'https://openalex.org/W1995422333', 'https://openalex.org/W4300419953', 'https://openalex.org/W135984148', 'https://openalex.org/W2103563049', 'https://openalex.org/W2610616322', 'https://openalex.org/W2404799143', 'https://openalex.org/W2135563147', 'https://openalex.org/W2143022183', 'https://openalex.org/W2963648280', 'https://openalex.org/W2021330098', 'https://openalex.org/W1998549181', 'https://openalex.org/W4300584482', 'https://openalex.org/W1596515083', 'https://openalex.org/W1997141060', 'https://openalex.org/W2001584575', 'https://openalex.org/W2399576818', 'https://openalex.org/W2407869992']",2019-05-01

Here we compare two recent methods for frame-level acoustic feature learning. For both methods, unsupervised term discovery is used to find pairs of word examples of the same unknown type. Dynamic programming is then used to align the feature frames between each word pair, serving as weak top-down supervision for the two models. For the correspondence autoencoder (CAE), matching frames are presented as input-output pairs. The Triamese network uses a contrastive loss to reduce the distance between frames of the same predicted word type while increasing the distance between negative examples. For the first time, these feature extractors are compared on the same discrimination tasks using the same weak supervision pairs. We find that, on the two datasets considered here, the CAE outperforms the Triamese network. However, we show that a new hybrid correspondence-Triamese approach (CTriamese), consistently outperforms both the CAE and Triamese models in terms of average precision and ABX error rates on both English and Xitsonga evaluation data.","['https://openalex.org/W6714100551', 'https://openalex.org/W6600284362', 'https://openalex.org/W2972764223', 'https://openalex.org/W2791647162', 'https://openalex.org/W2468716020', 'https://openalex.org/W6734095835', 'https://openalex.org/W2044138293', 'https://openalex.org/W2145410271', 'https://openalex.org/W6633682082', 'https://openalex.org/W2963720603', 'https://openalex.org/W2787447541', 'https://openalex.org/W6734901337', 'https://openalex.org/W2780786457', 'https://openalex.org/W2940544976', 'https://openalex.org/W2020607164', 'https://openalex.org/W6712202099', 'https://openalex.org/W6638159135', 'https://openalex.org/W2826003142', 'https://openalex.org/W2972867623', 'https://openalex.org/W2052697931', 'https://openalex.org/W2404799143', 'https://openalex.org/W1545920196', 'https://openalex.org/W2962980711', 'https://openalex.org/W6712444837', 'https://openalex.org/W1577418252', 'https://openalex.org/W2025482506', 'https://openalex.org/W2802557066', 'https://openalex.org/W2346964103', 'https://openalex.org/W6973666849', 'https://openalex.org/W2126203737', 'https://openalex.org/W2091746061', 'https://openalex.org/W2963620343', 'https://openalex.org/W2400549570', 'https://openalex.org/W2962850179', 'https://openalex.org/W2516890051', 'https://openalex.org/W1967924372', 'https://openalex.org/W2171590421', 'https://openalex.org/W2057007397', 'https://openalex.org/W2114347655']",2020-01-01

Frame label acquisition is an essential step in solving this\nproblem. High quality frame labels should be in good consistency with golden\ntranscriptions and robust to speaker variation. We propose to improve frame\nlabel acquisition in our previously adopted deep neural network-bottleneck\nfeature (DNN-BNF) architecture by applying the factorized hierarchical\nvariational autoencoder (FHVAE). FHVAEs learn to disentangle linguistic content\nand speaker identity information encoded in speech.

The goal is to learn\nrobust frame-level feature representations that can be used to identify and\ndistinguish subword-level speech units. The proposed feature representations\ncomprise various types of multilingual bottleneck features (BNFs) that are\nobtained via multi-task learning of deep neural networks (MTL-DNN). One of the\nkey problems is how to acquire high-quality frame labels for untranscribed\ntraining data to facilitate supervised DNN training. It is shown that learning\nof robust BNF representations can be achieved by effectively leveraging\ntranscribed speech data and well-trained automatic speech recognition (ASR)\nsystems from one or more out-of-domain (resource-rich) languages. Out-of-domain\nASR systems can be applied to perform speaker adaptation with untranscribed\ntraining data of the target language, and to decode the training speech into\nframe-level labels for DNN training. It is also found that better frame labels\ncan be generated by considering temporal dependency in speech when performing\nframe clustering. The proposed methods of feature learning are evaluated on the\nstandard task of unsupervised subword modeling in Track 1 of the ZeroSpeech\n2017 Challenge. The best performance achieved by our system is $9.7\\%$ in terms\nof across-speaker triphone minimal-pair ABX error rate, which is comparable to\nthe best systems reported recently. Lastly, our investigation reveals that the\ncloseness between target languages and out-of-domain languages and the amount\nof available training data for individual target languages could have\nsignificant impact on the goodness of learned features.\n","['https://openalex.org/W2747192917', 'https://openalex.org/W1975728937', 'https://openalex.org/W6677803786', 'https://openalex.org/W2785860501', 'https://openalex.org/W2826003142', 'https://openalex.org/W2767122664', 'https://openalex.org/W2167845555', 'https://openalex.org/W6640828828', 'https://openalex.org/W2921843068', 'https://openalex.org/W2594951208', 'https://openalex.org/W3100270690', 'https://openalex.org/W6638159135', 'https://openalex.org/W2785415724', 'https://openalex.org/W2627092829', 'https://openalex.org/W2963266252', 'https://openalex.org/W2787447541', 'https://openalex.org/W2586754519', 'https://openalex.org/W2759889345', 'https://openalex.org/W2895297209', 'https://openalex.org/W2810166208', 'https://openalex.org/W2509930204', 'https://openalex.org/W4239943352', 'https://openalex.org/W6631362777', 'https://openalex.org/W2057653135', 'https://openalex.org/W1528778941', 'https://openalex.org/W2513125788', 'https://openalex.org/W2614542633', 'https://openalex.org/W2295297373', 'https://openalex.org/W2786902352', 'https://openalex.org/W2787223168', 'https://openalex.org/W2889228998', 'https://openalex.org/W6677154653', 'https://openalex.org/W1545920196', 'https://openalex.org/W6786045457', 'https://openalex.org/W6678947187', 'https://openalex.org/W6712553779', 'https://openalex.org/W2514600732', 'https://openalex.org/W2160815625', 'https://openalex.org/W2963620343', 'https://openalex.org/W6748325621', 'https://openalex.org/W6640777149', 'https://openalex.org/W2055408826', 'https://openalex.org/W2072563337', 'https://openalex.org/W6973666849', 'https://openalex.org/W2005708641', 'https://openalex.org/W6696934422', 'https://openalex.org/W2400549570', 'https://openalex.org/W2120209245', 'https://openalex.org/W162588823', 'https://openalex.org/W2345811097']",2019-08-28

In this study, we propose a broad-coverage unsupervised neural network model to test memory and prediction as sources of signal by which children might acquire language directly from the perceptual stream. Our model embodies several likely properties of real-time human cognition: it is strictly incremental, it encodes speech into hierarchically organized labeled segments, it allows interactive top-down and bottom-up information flow, it attempts to model its own sequence of latent representations, and its objective function only recruits local signals that are plausibly supported by human working memory capacity. We show that much phonemic structure is learnable from unlabeled speech on the basis of these local signals. We further show that remembering the past and predicting the future both contribute to the linguistic content of acquired representations, and that these contributions are at least partially complementary.","['https://openalex.org/W2786608204', 'https://openalex.org/W2170716495', 'https://openalex.org/W2400668844', 'https://openalex.org/W1836465849', 'https://openalex.org/W2925135347',

We provide Perceptimatic, an open data set which consists of French and English speech stimuli, as well as the results of 91 English- and 93 French-speaking listeners. The stimuli test a wide range of French and English contrasts, and are extracted directly from corpora of natural running read speech, used for the 2017 Zero Resource Speech Challenge. We provide a method to compare humans' perceptual space with models' representational space, and we apply it to models previously submitted to the Challenge. We show that, unlike unsupervised models and supervised multilingual models, a standard supervised monolingual HMM-GMM phone recognition system, while good at discriminating phones, yields a representational space very different from that of human native listeners.","['https://openalex.org/W1524333225', 'https://openalex.org/W2785415724', 'https://openalex.org/W2963620343', 'https://openalex.org/W2786902352', 'https://openalex.org/W2787223168', 'https://openalex.org/W2911249026', 'https://openalex.org/W2940544976', 'https://openalex.org/W2963980299', 'https://openalex.org/W4288279357', 'https://openalex.org/W1568183767', 'https://openalex.org/W2787426069', 'https://openalex.org/W3023172065', 'https://openalex.org/W2730658205', 'https://openalex.org/W2517346207', 'https://openalex.org/W2759889345', 'https://openalex.org/W2399576818', 'https://openalex.org/W2786337938', 'https://openalex.org/W4288107125', 'https://openalex.org/W2786608204', 'https://openalex.org/W2325526696', 'https://openalex.org/W2787447541', 'https://openalex.org/W4300047444', 'https://openalex.org/W2889500720', 'https://openalex.org/W2768352418']",2020-10-25

These representations significantly reduce the amount of labeled data needed for downstream task performance, such as automatic speech recognition. CPC learns representations by learning to predict future frames given current frames. Based on the observation that the acoustic information, e.g., phones, changes slower than the feature extraction rate in CPC, we propose regularization techniques that impose slowness constraints on the features. Here we propose two regularization techniques: Self-expressing constraint and Left-or-Right regularization. We evaluate the proposed model on ABX and linear phone classification tasks, acoustic unit discovery, and automatic speech recognition. The regularized CPC trained on 100 hours of unlabeled data matches the performance of the baseline CPC trained on 360 hours of unlabeled data. We also show that our regularization techniques are complementary to data augmentation and can further boost the system's performance. In monolingual, cross-lingual, or multilingual settings, with/without data augmentation, regardless of the amount of data used for training, our regularized models outperformed the baseline CPC models on the ABX task.","['https://openalex.org/W2160815625', 'https://openalex.org/W2150769028', 'https://openalex.org/W4301204483', 'https://openalex.org/W2057007397', 'https://openalex.org/W2020607164', 'https://openalex.org/W2117041980', 'https://openalex.org/W2170659185', 'https://openalex.org/W6675022971', 'https://openalex.org/W2078769636', 'https://openalex.org/W2468716020', 'https://openalex.org/W2747192917', 'https://openalex.org/W2964169922', 'https://openalex.org/W2890718354', 'https://openalex.org/W6844194202', 'https://openalex.org/W2973049979', 'https://openalex.org/W6780218876', 'https://openalex.org/W3016181583', 'https://openalex.org/W6755207826', 'https://openalex.org/W6766673545', 'https://openalex.org/W3159481202', 'https://openalex.org/W4385822676', 'https://openalex.org/W3100270690', 'https://openalex.org/W3198782837', 'https://openalex.org/W3197974236', 'https://openalex.org/W3209993061', 'https://openalex.org/W6838949706', 'https://openalex.org/W3097159218', 'https://openalex.org/W2936774411', 'https://openalex.org/W3144810982', 'https://openalex.org/W2786608204', 'https://openalex.org/W2346964103', 'https://openalex.org/W2963620343', 'https://openalex.org/W2940544976', 'https://openalex.org/W6799172387', 'https://openalex.org/W2963720603', 'https://openalex.org/W1796128977', 'https://openalex.org/W6640963894', 'https://openalex.org/W2752796333', 'https://openalex.org/W3096656254', 'https://openalex.org/W3095361818', 'https://openalex.org/W2146444479', 'https://openalex.org/W6774456908', 'https://openalex.org/W3198134274', 'https://openalex.org/W4313182775', 'https://openalex.org/W3204915839', 'https://openalex.org/W2395899413', 'https://openalex.org/W4385245566', 'https://openalex.org/W2787447541', 'https://openalex.org/W3198815374']",2024-01-01

Our sampler jointly infers a codebook and clusters. The codebook is a global collection of components. Clusters are mixtures, defined over the codebook. We combine a nonergodic Gibbs sampler with two layers of split and merge samplers on codebook and mixture level to form a valid ergodic chain. We design an additional switch sampler for components that supports convergence in our experimental results. In the use case of unsupervised subword modeling, we show that our method infers complex classes from real speech feature vectors that consistently show higher quality on several evaluation metrics. At the same time, we infer fewer classes that represent subword units more consistently and show longer durations, compared to a standard Dirichlet process mixture model sampler.","['https://openalex.org/W2152051032', 'https://openalex.org/W2090861223', 'https://openalex.org/W6712444837', 'https://openalex.org/W1994897900', 'https://openalex.org/W2072169887', 'https://openalex.org/W6631362777', 'https://openalex.org/W2044138293', 'https://openalex.org/W2145410271', 'https://openalex.org/W6636447677', 'https://openalex.org/W6712553779', 'https://openalex.org/W2124629003', 'https://openalex.org/W6748489002', 'https://openalex.org/W6704305767', 'https://openalex.org/W2509930204', 'https://openalex.org/W6748342566', 'https://openalex.org/W1920769845', 'https://openalex.org/W1977286842', 'https://openalex.org/W2586754519', 'https://openalex.org/W2101998432', 'https://openalex.org/W6674922813', 'https://openalex.org/W2062373184', 'https://openalex.org/W6678007500', 'https://openalex.org/W1971807270', 'https://openalex.org/W6677150433', 'https://openalex.org/W6973666849', 'https://openalex.org/W1967687583', 'https://openalex.org/W6697293080', 'https://openalex.org/W2069429561', 'https://openalex.org/W6678007862', 'https://openalex.org/W6602662854', 'https://openalex.org/W6678947187', 'https://openalex.org/W1599512239', 'https://openalex.org/W6684363390', 'https://openalex.org/W2106554350', 'https://openalex.org/W1975427826', 'https://openalex.org/W2162021827', 'https://openalex.org/W2002342963', 'https://openalex.org/W1560013842', 'https://openalex.org/W2399576818', 'https://openalex.org/W2128032727', 'https://openalex.org/W1613448136', 'https://openalex.org/W2395899413', 'https://openalex.org/W3101455611', 'https://openalex.org/W2787447541', 'https://openalex.org/W2786902352', 'https://openalex.org/W1589170661', 'https://openalex.org/W2786608204', 'https://openalex.org/W2345811097', 'https://openalex.org/W1524333225', 'https://openalex.org/W2615915281', 'https://openalex.org/W2405618829', 'https://openalex.org/W2963620343', 'https://openalex.org/W2120636621', 'https://openalex.org/W2600717762', 'https://openalex.org/W2100163972', 'https://openalex.org/W2113037082', 'https://openalex.org/W2120432176', 'https://openalex.org/W64187236']",2018-07-02

Past studies usually proposed single-step approaches. We propose a two-stage approach: the first stage learns a subword-discriminative feature representation and the second stage applies clustering to the learned representation and obtains phone-like clusters as the discovered acoustic units. In the first stage, a recently proposed method in the task of unsupervised subword modeling is improved by replacing a monolingual out-of-domain (OOD) ASR system with a multilingual one to create a subword-discriminative representation that is more language-independent. In the second stage, segment-level k-means is adopted, and two methods to represent the variable-length speech segments as fixed-dimension feature vectors are compared. Experiments on a very low-resource Mboshi language corpus show that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art AUD in both normalized mutual information (NMI) and F-score. The multilingual ASR improved upon the monolingual ASR in providing OOD phone labels and in estimating the phone boundaries. A comparison of our systems with and without knowing the ground-truth phone boundaries showed a 16% NMI performance gap, suggesting that the current approach can significantly benefit from improved phone boundary estimation.","['https://openalex.org/W2964169922', 'https://openalex.org/W2972943112', 'https://openalex.org/W1957665339', 'https://openalex.org/W2100768664', 'https://openalex.org/W2973026522', 'https://openalex.org/W2594951208', 'https://openalex.org/W2962693497', 'https://openalex.org/W2963799213', 'https://openalex.org/W2972794572', 'https://openalex.org/W3095361818', 'https://openalex.org/W3044483536', 'https://openalex.org/W2147768505', 'https://openalex.org/W2995181338', 'https://openalex.org/W2963620343', 'https://openalex.org/W3104842308', 'https://openalex.org/W2347145335', 'https://openalex.org/W3093096176', 'https://openalex.org/W1524333225', 'https://openalex.org/W2972574141', 'https://openalex.org/W2787447541', 'https://openalex.org/W2101234009', 'https://openalex.org/W3045485643', 'https://openalex.org/W3016181583', 'https://openalex.org/W2895297209', 'https://openalex.org/W2950414763', 'https://openalex.org/W3100202343', 'https://openalex.org/W2750248772', 'https://openalex.org/W1557247526', 'https://openalex.org/W2514741789', 'https://openalex.org/W3025286576', 'https://openalex.org/W2762715843', 'https://openalex.org/W2996383576', 'https://openalex.org/W3094197178', 'https://openalex.org/W3095732712', 'https://openalex.org/W1631260214', 'https://openalex.org/W2327501763', 'https://openalex.org/W2347098582', 'https://openalex.org/W1975728937', 'https://openalex.org/W2963678298', 'https://openalex.org/W2399576818', 'https://openalex.org/W2059652594', 'https://openalex.org/W66627554']",2021-08-27

We employ the factorized hierarchical variational autoencoder (FHVAE) to learn an unsupervised feature representation by encoding the linguistic-relevant information into latent variables. In order to obtain more significant latent variables, the attention mechanism is introduced into the encoders of FHVAE. In addition to the reconstruction decoder of FHVAE, the phonetic-aware decoder is introduced to backward transmit the phonemic information into the latent variables, enhancing the performance of feature representation learning. The idea of multi-task learning is used to organize the encoders of FHVAE, the reconstruction decoder of FHVAE and the phonetic-aware decoder into the training process. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, the ABX discriminability and the language identification are evaluated on the ZeroSpeech 2017 and the LRE 2017 respectively. These experimental results shown that the learned feature representation outperforms traditional acoustic feature.","['https://openalex.org/W6712553779', 'https://openalex.org/W2509930204', 'https://openalex.org/W2972841524', 'https://openalex.org/W3094658127', 'https://openalex.org/W3096210705', 'https://openalex.org/W2889162002', 'https://openalex.org/W3094861110', 'https://openalex.org/W2787223168', 'https://openalex.org/W2787447541', 'https://openalex.org/W1984076147', 'https://openalex.org/W3007486152', 'https://openalex.org/W2809271438', 'https://openalex.org/W2963620343', 'https://openalex.org/W2786902352', 'https://openalex.org/W2972314145', 'https://openalex.org/W2826003142', 'https://openalex.org/W2614542633', 'https://openalex.org/W2785860501', 'https://openalex.org/W3097649098', 'https://openalex.org/W3100270690', 'https://openalex.org/W2916297645', 'https://openalex.org/W6745117592', 'https://openalex.org/W2406392101', 'https://openalex.org/W2890964092', 'https://openalex.org/W2758785877', 'https://openalex.org/W3125709657', 'https://openalex.org/W2398046886', 'https://openalex.org/W2963618559', 'https://openalex.org/W2399576818']",2021-05-07

UAM is not only important in addressing the general problem of data scarcity in ASR technology development but also essential to many non-mainstream applications, for examples, language protection, language acquisition and pathological speech assessment. The present study is focused on two research problems. The first problem concerns unsupervised discovery of basic (subword level) speech units in a given language. Under the zero-resource condition, the speech units could be inferred only from the acoustic signals, without requiring or involving any linguistic direction and/or constraints. The second problem is referred to as unsupervised subword modeling. In its essence a frame-level feature representation needs to be learned from untranscribed speech. The learned feature representation is the basis of subword unit discovery. It is desired to be linguistically discriminative and robust to non-linguistic factors. Particularly extensive use of cross-lingual knowledge in subword unit discovery and modeling is a focus of this research.","['https://openalex.org/W2962693497', 'https://openalex.org/W2963826681', 'https://openalex.org/W2345811097', 'https://openalex.org/W2120209245', 'https://openalex.org/W2963618559', 'https://openalex.org/W2026858810', 'https://openalex.org/W2963620343', 'https://openalex.org/W2402963799', 'https://openalex.org/W2396043527', 'https://openalex.org/W1975728937', 'https://openalex.org/W1599512239', 'https://openalex.org/W2102113734', 'https://openalex.org/W1967924372', 'https://openalex.org/W2024490156', 'https://openalex.org/W1833498382', 'https://openalex.org/W2124558353', 'https://openalex.org/W2115685217', 'https://openalex.org/W2962826786', 'https://openalex.org/W2513125788', 'https://openalex.org/W2112688413', 'https://openalex.org/W2786902352', 'https://openalex.org/W2399978376', 'https://openalex.org/W2888911345', 'https://openalex.org/W2972706021', 'https://openalex.org/W2293634267', 'https://openalex.org/W2964245029', 'https://openalex.org/W2025198378', 'https://openalex.org/W2072563337', 'https://openalex.org/W2404799143', 'https://openalex.org/W2895297209', 'https://openalex.org/W1957665339', 'https://openalex.org/W2641832364', 'https://openalex.org/W2963134917', 'https://openalex.org/W2787223168', 'https://openalex.org/W2962689740', 'https://openalex.org/W2162021827', 'https://openalex.org/W2586754519', 'https://openalex.org/W2399576818', 'https://openalex.org/W1545920196', 'https://openalex.org/W3125709657', 'https://openalex.org/W2401464865', 'https://openalex.org/W2110589736', 'https://openalex.org/W2187089797', 'https://openalex.org/W2048526313', 'https://openalex.org/W2509930204', 'https://openalex.org/W2964121744', 'https://openalex.org/W2962799225', 'https://openalex.org/W1778492285', 'https://openalex.org/W2936120996', 'https://openalex.org/W2295297373', 'https://openalex.org/W2128032727', 'https://openalex.org/W2057007397', 'https://openalex.org/W1959608418', 'https://openalex.org/W2889228998', 'https://openalex.org/W1524333225', 'https://openalex.org/W2398071208', 'https://openalex.org/W2787426069', 'https://openalex.org/W2796339975', 'https://openalex.org/W1631260214', 'https://openalex.org/W2963381607', 'https://openalex.org/W2972812366', 'https://openalex.org/W2787447541', 'https://openalex.org/W2122272452', 'https://openalex.org/W2080972498', 'https://openalex.org/W1526516369', 'https://openalex.org/W2125838338', 'https://openalex.org/W1965842648', 'https://openalex.org/W2514012605', 'https://openalex.org/W2152051032', 'https://openalex.org/W2614542633', 'https://openalex.org/W3095049654', 'https://openalex.org/W2748598007', 'https://openalex.org/W2056786202', 'https://openalex.org/W308497914', 'https://openalex.org/W2403015869', 'https://openalex.org/W1950396994', 'https://openalex.org/W2002342963', 'https://openalex.org/W2160815625', 'https://openalex.org/W2785860501', 'https://openalex.org/W1984076147', 'https://openalex.org/W162588823', 'https://openalex.org/W2963137467', 'https://openalex.org/W2100768664', 'https://openalex.org/W2914746235', 'https://openalex.org/W2005708641', 'https://openalex.org/W2963684067', 'https://openalex.org/W2062914951', 'https://openalex.org/W2057653135', 'https://openalex.org/W2015688877', 'https://openalex.org/W3145738572', 'https://openalex.org/W2810166208', 'https://openalex.org/W2100969003', 'https://openalex.org/W2594951208', 'https://openalex.org/W2400549570', 'https://openalex.org/W2083904075', 'https://openalex.org/W2962684181', 'https://openalex.org/W2140567543', 'https://openalex.org/W2072349636', 'https://openalex.org/W1965555277', 'https://openalex.org/W2116422968', 'https://openalex.org/W3007486152', 'https://openalex.org/W2785415724', 'https://openalex.org/W2171752983', 'https://openalex.org/W2078769636', 'https://openalex.org/W2750248772', 'https://openalex.org/W2347098582', 'https://openalex.org/W2405703722', 'https://openalex.org/W185189022', 'https://openalex.org/W1528778941', 'https://openalex.org/W2168319451', 'https://openalex.org/W2766219058', 'https://openalex.org/W1796128977', 'https://openalex.org/W3105242324', 'https://openalex.org/W2106554350', 'https://openalex.org/W2518312472', 'https://openalex.org/W2121997342', 'https://openalex.org/W2972574141', 'https://openalex.org/W2786608204', 'https://openalex.org/W1578200545', 'https://openalex.org/W2127498532', 'https://openalex.org/W2826003142']",2020-07-29
https://openalex.org/W3110585608,https://doi.org/10.48550/arxiv.2011.14060,Unsupervised Spoken Term Discovery on Untranscribed Speech,"(Part of the abstract) In this thesis, we investigate the use of unsupervised spoken term discovery in tackling this problem. Unsupervised spoken term discovery aims to discover topic-related terminologies in a speech without knowing the phonetic properties of the language and content. It can be further divided into two parts: Acoustic segment modelling (ASM) and unsupervised pattern discovery. ASM learns the phonetic structures of zero-resource language audio with no phonetic knowledge available, generating self-derived ""phonemes"". The audio are labelled with these ""phonemes"" to obtain ""phoneme"" sequences. Unsupervised pattern discovery searches for repetitive patterns in the ""phoneme"" sequences. The discovered patterns can be grouped to determine the keywords of the audio. Multilingual neural network with bottleneck layer is used for feature extraction. Experiments show that bottleneck features facilitate the training of ASM compared to conventional features such as MFCC. The unsupervised spoken term discovery system is experimented with online lectures covering different topics by different speakers. It is shown that the system learns the phonetic information of the language and can discover frequent spoken terms that align with text transcription. By using information retrieval technology such as word embedding and TFIDF, it is shown that the discovered keywords can be further used for topic comparison.","['https://openalex.org/W3021051756', 'https://openalex.org/W1778492285', 'https://openalex.org/W2746778230', 'https://openalex.org/W3105242324', 'https://openalex.org/W2129634963', 'https://openalex.org/W1821462560', 'https://openalex.org/W1501500081', 'https://openalex.org/W1555148682', 'https://openalex.org/W1128809682', 'https://openalex.org/W2964169922', 'https://openalex.org/W2142416747', 'https://openalex.org/W2468716020', 'https://openalex.org/W2103359087', 'https://openalex.org/W2950577311', 'https://openalex.org/W2171752983', 'https://openalex.org/W1604771987', 'https://openalex.org/W2126377586', 'https://openalex.org/W2165712214', 'https://openalex.org/W2293634267', 'https://openalex.org/W2573062194', 'https://openalex.org/W1978660892', 'https://openalex.org/W2127141656', 'https://openalex.org/W2072563337', 'https://openalex.org/W2122538988', 'https://openalex.org/W2406504561', 'https://openalex.org/W2594951208', 'https://openalex.org/W2090861223', 'https://openalex.org/W2118841860', 'https://openalex.org/W1538131130', 'https://openalex.org/W1981706894', 'https://openalex.org/W2147768505', 'https://openalex.org/W1970890968', 'https://openalex.org/W1995562189', 'https://openalex.org/W1975728937', 'https://openalex.org/W2172097686', 'https://openalex.org/W2115870554', 'https://openalex.org/W2962826786', 'https://openalex.org/W2110087182', 'https://openalex.org/W2087064593', 'https://openalex.org/W2044048901', 'https://openalex.org/W2913066018', 'https://openalex.org/W1525783482', 'https://openalex.org/W2098044214', 'https://openalex.org/W3144750446', 'https://openalex.org/W2111732304', 'https://openalex.org/W1998871699', 'https://openalex.org/W2752630748', 'https://openalex.org/W3023071679', 'https://openalex.org/W2148154194', 'https://openalex.org/W2127218421', 'https://openalex.org/W2114347655', 'https://openalex.org/W2087863531', 'https://openalex.org/W2604132379', 'https://openalex.org/W2161482971', 'https://openalex.org/W1902405276', 'https://openalex.org/W2166782149', 'https://openalex.org/W2057007397', 'https://openalex.org/W2526425061', 'https://openalex.org/W2124558353', 'https://openalex.org/W2116422968', 'https://openalex.org/W2121997342', 'https://openalex.org/W1507597442', 'https://openalex.org/W2110589736', 'https://openalex.org/W2184045248', 'https://openalex.org/W2787447541', 'https://openalex.org/W2023812146', 'https://openalex.org/W2786902352', 'https://openalex.org/W2078769636', 'https://openalex.org/W2901751252', 'https://openalex.org/W2963620343', 'https://openalex.org/W2083904075', 'https://openalex.org/W2090958120', 'https://openalex.org/W1957665339', 'https://openalex.org/W2399869768', 'https://openalex.org/W2060895888', 'https://openalex.org/W151377110', 'https://openalex.org/W2024490156', 'https://openalex.org/W2064675550', 'https://openalex.org/W1600310449', 'https://openalex.org/W2143612262', 'https://openalex.org/W2159948109', 'https://openalex.org/W2680270903', 'https://openalex.org/W2025198378', 'https://openalex.org/W2115008841', 'https://openalex.org/W2962799225', 'https://openalex.org/W2130942839', 'https://openalex.org/W2402196427', 'https://openalex.org/W2187089797', 'https://openalex.org/W3127686677', 'https://openalex.org/W1902237438', 'https://openalex.org/W2102113734', 'https://openalex.org/W2103869314', 'https://openalex.org/W854541894', 'https://openalex.org/W2173629880', 'https://openalex.org/W2043513994', 'https://openalex.org/W2403015869', 'https://openalex.org/W1815792', 'https://openalex.org/W162588823', 'https://openalex.org/W2402146185', 'https://openalex.org/W2100768664', 'https://openalex.org/W2806921177', 'https://openalex.org/W2950919476', 'https://openalex.org/W1673310716', 'https://openalex.org/W3095049654']",2020-11-28

In this work we propose an unsupervised speaker normalization technique prior to unit discovery. It is based on separating speaker related from content induced variations in a speech signal with an adversarial contrastive predictive coding approach. This technique does neither require transcribed speech nor speaker labels, and, furthermore, can be trained in a multilingual fashion, thus achieving speaker normalization even if only few unlabeled data is available from the target language. The speaker normalization is done by mapping all utterances to a medoid style which is representative for the whole database. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach by conducting acoustic unit discovery with a hidden Markov model variational autoencoder noting, however, that the proposed speaker normalization can serve as a front end to any unit discovery system. Experiments on English, Yoruba and Mboshi show improvements compared to using non-normalized input.","['https://openalex.org/W2962695963', 'https://openalex.org/W2753738274', 'https://openalex.org/W3125709657', 'https://openalex.org/W2963799213', 'https://openalex.org/W1967924372', 'https://openalex.org/W1494198834', 'https://openalex.org/W2106119541', 'https://openalex.org/W2940544976', 'https://openalex.org/W2951004968', 'https://openalex.org/W2762715843', 'https://openalex.org/W3127686677', 'https://openalex.org/W2750248772', 'https://openalex.org/W2963620343', 'https://openalex.org/W2142384583', 'https://openalex.org/W2888911345', 'https://openalex.org/W2933771351', 'https://openalex.org/W2963618559', 'https://openalex.org/W2157590573', 'https://openalex.org/W1522301498', 'https://openalex.org/W2842511635', 'https://openalex.org/W3030987249', 'https://openalex.org/W2483390977', 'https://openalex.org/W2787447541', 'https://openalex.org/W2025482506', 'https://openalex.org/W2950414763', 'https://openalex.org/W3092791109', 'https://openalex.org/W3101380508', 'https://openalex.org/W2022058071', 'https://openalex.org/W3100202343', 'https://openalex.org/W3162390194', 'https://openalex.org/W2140567543']",2021-05-04

Recently, zero-resource acoustic modeling has gained much interest. One research problem is unsupervised subword modeling (USM), i.e., learning a feature representation that can distinguish subword units and is robust to speaker variation. Previous studies showed that self-supervised learning (SSL) has the potential to separate speaker and phonetic information in speech in an unsupervised manner, which is highly desired in USM. This paper compares two representative SSL algorithms, namely, contrastive predictive coding (CPC) and autoregressive predictive coding (APC), as a front-end method of a recently proposed, state-of-the art two-stage approach, to learn a representation as input to a back-end cross-lingual DNN. Experiments show that the bottleneck features extracted by the back-end achieved state of the art in a subword ABX task on the Libri-light and ZeroSpeech databases. In general, CPC is more effective than APC as the front-end in our approach, which is independent of the choice of the out-domain language identity in the back-end cross-lingual DNN and the training data amount. With very limited training data, APC is found similar or more effective than CPC when test data consists of long utterances.","['https://openalex.org/W2787447541', 'https://openalex.org/W3016181583', 'https://openalex.org/W2971041032', 'https://openalex.org/W2752796333', 'https://openalex.org/W2842511635', 'https://openalex.org/W2972943112', 'https://openalex.org/W6748325621', 'https://openalex.org/W2889228998', 'https://openalex.org/W3112085130', 'https://openalex.org/W3040997499', 'https://openalex.org/W3148101939', 'https://openalex.org/W3044483536', 'https://openalex.org/W2514741789', 'https://openalex.org/W2786608204', 'https://openalex.org/W3196459653', 'https://openalex.org/W2347098582', 'https://openalex.org/W6697293080', 'https://openalex.org/W3100270690', 'https://openalex.org/W6675022971', 'https://openalex.org/W2399576818', 'https://openalex.org/W3005578234', 'https://openalex.org/W3150635893', 'https://openalex.org/W6601192135', 'https://openalex.org/W2995181338', 'https://openalex.org/W6631362777', 'https://openalex.org/W6631190155', 'https://openalex.org/W1522301498', 'https://openalex.org/W3160200310', 'https://openalex.org/W2100768664', 'https://openalex.org/W2296607128', 'https://openalex.org/W29952999', 'https://openalex.org/W2787426069', 'https://openalex.org/W1524333225', 'https://openalex.org/W4297808394', 'https://openalex.org/W2963799213']",2021-10-31

However, the massive growth of mini programs has led to concerns about protecting the copyright of their code. Currently, there is not enough research on clone detection for mini programs, and the language features of mini programs make it difficult to detect plagiarism due to incomplete behaviour observation and challenges in calculating similarity. To address this gap, we propose MIPAD, a detection method based on static feature analysis, including statistical features (SF) for clustering analysis, layout features (LF), and code features (CFF, FDF, TLDF) for similarity detection. To enhance the robustness of the LF and CFF, FDF, TLDF features during the feature extraction phase, we used a fuzzy hash algorithm. To speed up the dependency graph similarity computation, we propose a fast anchor-based similarity computation algorithm. To address the lack of publicly available large sample datasets in this domain, we designed a mini program crawler method that can fuzzy crawl samples based on a seed list and expand the list in real-time, and we used this method to crawl 100,000-level mini program samples. Using these samples, we evaluated MIPAD using a Random Forest as a classifier and X-means as a clusterizer, which showed an accuracy of 90.5% and an average sample time overhead of 15. 83s, demonstrating that MIPAD can detect cloned mini programs quickly and effectively.","['https://openalex.org/W1964940342', 'https://openalex.org/W2911964244', 'https://openalex.org/W1977177161', 'https://openalex.org/W2963213304', 'https://openalex.org/W2128698639', 'https://openalex.org/W2157532207', 'https://openalex.org/W3142518606', 'https://openalex.org/W2741705590', 'https://openalex.org/W2128782367', 'https://openalex.org/W2138756793', 'https://openalex.org/W2767717989', 'https://openalex.org/W2104301886', 'https://openalex.org/W6681648988', 'https://openalex.org/W2111295912', 'https://openalex.org/W2088479623', 'https://openalex.org/W6635035540', 'https://openalex.org/W6681029592', 'https://openalex.org/W2787447541', 'https://openalex.org/W2002083372', 'https://openalex.org/W2146659255', 'https://openalex.org/W1585610988', 'https://openalex.org/W2142498761']",2023-06-01

In the wake of this transition, a number of all-neural ASR architectures have been introduced. These so-called <italic xmlns:mml=""http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"" xmlns:xlink=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"">end-to-end</i> (E2E) models provide highly integrated, completely neural ASR models, which rely strongly on general machine learning knowledge, learn more consistently from data, with lower dependence on ASR domain-specific experience. The success and enthusiastic adoption of deep learning, accompanied by more generic model architectures has led to E2E models now becoming the prominent ASR approach. The goal of this survey is to provide a taxonomy of E2E ASR models and corresponding improvements, and to discuss their properties and their relationship to classical hidden Markov model (HMM) based ASR architectures. All relevant aspects of E2E ASR are covered in this work: modeling, training, decoding, and external language model integration, discussions of performance and deployment opportunities, as well as an

FunCodec provides reproducible training recipes and inference scripts for the latest neural speech codec models, such as SoundStream and Encodec. Thanks to the unified design with FunASR, FunCodec can be easily integrated into downstream tasks, such as speech recognition. Along with FunCodec, pretrained models are also provided, which can be used for academic or generalized purposes. Based on the toolkit, we further propose the frequency-domain codec models, FreqCodec, which can achieve comparable speech quality with much lower computation and parameter complexity. Experimental results show that, under the same compression ratio, FunCodec can achieve better reconstruction quality compared with other toolkits and released models. We also demonstrate that the pre-trained models are suitable for downstream tasks, including automatic speech recognition and personalized text-to-speech synthesis.

However, it is still unknown whether state-of-the-art LLMs master sufficient knowledge related to heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) systems. It will be inspiring if LLMs can think and learn like professionals in the HVAC industry. Hence, this study investigates the performance of LLMs on mastering the knowledge and skills related to the HVAC industry by letting them take the ASHRAE Certified HVAC Designer examination, an authoritative examination in the HVAC industry. Three key knowledge capabilities are explored: recall, analysis and application. Twelve representative LLMs are tested such as GPT-3.5, GPT-4 and LLaMA. According to the results, GPT-4 passes the ASHRAE Certified HVAC Designer examination with scores from 74 to 78, which is higher than about half of human examinees. Besides, GPT-3.5 passes the examination twice out of five times. It demonstrates that some LLMs such as GPT-4 and GPT-3.5 have great potential to assist or replace humans in designing and operating HVAC systems. However, they still make some mistakes sometimes due to the lack of knowledge, poor reasoning capabilities and unsatisfactory equation calculation abilities. Accordingly, four future research directions are proposed to reveal how to utilize and improve LLMs in the HVAC industry: teaching LLMs to use design tools or software in the HVAC industry, enabling LLMs to read and analyze the operational data from HVAC systems, developing tailored corpuses for the HVAC industry, and assessing the performance of LLMs in real-world HVAC design and operation scenarios.","['https://openalex.org/W3168442825', 'https://openalex.org/W4283388850', 'https://openalex.org/W3092537909', 'https://openalex.org/W4360618334', 'https://openalex.org/W6857939860', 'https://openalex.org/W6793792376', 'https://openalex.org/W4385566703', 'https://openalex.org/W1976960445', 'https://openalex.org/W2804844200', 'https://openalex.org/W2079074068', 'https://openalex.org/W2917212430', 'https://openalex.org/W6854039168', 'https://openalex.org/W6810608687', 'https://openalex.org/W2587347436', 'https://openalex.org/W1776296525', 'https://openalex.org/W1973944436', 'https://openalex.org/W3132263092', 'https://openalex.org/W4283770334', 'https://openalex.org/W4380987486', 'https://openalex.org/W4390498569', 'https://openalex.org/W4316012702', 'https://openalex.org/W6795217850', 'https://openalex.org/W6777023006', 'https://openalex.org/W3153794886', 'https://openalex.org/W4388248488', 'https://openalex.org/W4363671827', 'https://openalex.org/W4322718191', 'https://openalex.org/W4223442835', 'https://openalex.org/W3162029264', 'https://openalex.org/W4377865110', 'https://openalex.org/W4362693613', 'https://openalex.org/W4381487652', 'https://openalex.org/W4378501656', 'https://openalex.org/W4360891289']",2024-03-27

However, synthetic speech is prone to be mixed with real human speech as part of the noise and recorded by the microphone, which leads to performance decrease for speech recognition. To address this issue, we propose different methods to study the adverse impact of synthetic speech on speech recognition, thereby enhancing its robustness. On the one hand, we adopt the concept of fake audio detection and incorporate an additional module into speech recognition model to differentiate between real and synthetic speech. On the other hand, we propose various methods of incorporating prompt labels from a language semantics perspective to achieve differentiation. These prompt labels provide contextual cues that help speech recognition model to better understand the difference between the two types of speech. The experimental results demonstrate the acoustic modeling of ASR is capable of distinguishing between real and synthetic speech effectively. Putting the prompt labels at the beginning achieves the best performance in a clean synthetic data scenario, while emptying the transcripts of synthetic speech obtains the best performance in a noisy synthetic data scenario.","['https://openalex.org/W6783867762', 'https://openalex.org/W4297841605', 'https://openalex.org/W6848735303', 'https://openalex.org/W3006752097', 'https://openalex.org/W3016008406', 'https://openalex.org/W3080248383', 'https://openalex.org/W4281712850', 'https://openalex.org/W4225873749', 'https://openalex.org/W4385573729', 'https://openalex.org/W4298633873', 'https://openalex.org/W3134568285', 'https://openalex.org/W4372259861', 'https://openalex.org/W3013139777', 'https://openalex.org/W6778883912', 'https://openalex.org/W6810738896', 'https://openalex.org/W6847363464', 'https://openalex.org/W6853998256', 'https://openalex.org/W6853611000', 'https://openalex.org/W2963242190', 'https://openalex.org/W4283067311', 'https://openalex.org/W4385822407', 'https://openalex.org/W4313679638', 'https://openalex.org/W4292779060', 'https://openalex.org/W4226278401', 'https://openalex.org/W3092028330', 'https://openalex.org/W4378501656', 'https://openalex.org/W4381827575']",2024-03-18

Although it has achieved great success in high-resource languages, it still remains challenging in low-resource languages due to the lack of labeled training data. Consequently, there is growing interest in code-switching method for cross-lingual SLU to solve the problem in the low-resource languages. However, despite the success of existing models, most of these methods fail to effectively leverage the code-switched utterances. In this paper, we propose a novel framework termed CMM for zero-shot cross-lingual SLU which simplifies the learning task for the model. Specifically, we apply both mixup and curriculum learning method to dynamically combine the information from pure utterances and code-switched utterances. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed framework improves the performance compared to several strong baselines and achieves the state-of-the-art performance on MultiATIS++ dataset, with a relative improvement of 3.0% in terms of overall accuracy over the previous best model.","['https://openalex.org/W4385572615', 'https://openalex.org/W4385571399', 'https://openalex.org/W4385822317', 'https://openalex.org/W4385822945', 'https://openalex.org/W4385822432', 'https://openalex.org/W4390874127', 'https://openalex.org/W2153962611', 'https://openalex.org/W3098101716', 'https://openalex.org/W2997214274', 'https://openalex.org/W3034724424', 'https://openalex.org/W2970850076', 'https://openalex.org/W4375839990', 'https://openalex.org/W2996987694', 'https://openalex.org/W3175665465', 'https://openalex.org/W6846505686', 'https://openalex.org/W4385822428', 'https://openalex.org/W4390872315', 'https://openalex.org/W4385807416', 'https://openalex.org/W2803392141', 'https://openalex.org/W4375869190', 'https://openalex.org/W4224212267', 'https://openalex.org/W4385573356', 'https://openalex.org/W6755207826', 'https://openalex.org/W3166631396', 'https://openalex.org/W3003813211', 'https://openalex.org/W3100251125', 'https://openalex.org/W6838684908', 'https://openalex.org/W6631190155', 'https://openalex.org/W3098800734', 'https://openalex.org/W3173794693', 'https://openalex.org/W2917128112', 'https://openalex.org/W4280593916', 'https://openalex.org/W4379540238', 'https://openalex.org/W4327810154', 'https://openalex.org/W4288099666', 'https://openalex.org/W3103469330']",2023-10-01

There are many studies work in the field of building network architecture to deal with this task. While data augmentation was deeply discovered in computer vision, it is a big lag behind in the field of speech. Large data collection is not trivial, and in some cases it is impossible. The problem with data size is even more serious in some low-resource languages, such as Vietnamese. This study focuses on the data augmentation approach to deal with the small-size datasets to help the deep learning network better coverage in the ASR task. The experiment results on various configures of the VIVOS dataset, and two variations of the Conformer network architecture show that our proposed method gets promising improvement.","['https://openalex.org/W6640090968', 'https://openalex.org/W6739901393', 'https://openalex.org/W3097777922', 'https://openalex.org/W2127141656', 'https://openalex.org/W6638749077', 'https://openalex.org/W3198214208', 'https://openalex.org/W3201468377', 'https://openalex.org/W3163605596', 'https://openalex.org/W4226278833', 'https://openalex.org/W2407080277', 'https://openalex.org/W3203483482', 'https://openalex.org/W2696967604', 'https://openalex.org/W3109486980', 'https://openalex.org/W3080135102', 'https://openalex.org/W2936774411', 'https://openalex.org/W3196824004', 'https://openalex.org/W3197976714', 'https://openalex.org/W3015654635', 'https://openalex.org/W1899504021', 'https://openalex.org/W2892009249', 'https://openalex.org/W2972451902', 'https://openalex.org/W6670489057', 'https://openalex.org/W1828163288', 'https://openalex.org/W4288088457', 'https://openalex.org/W3035682985']",2022-10-31

To solve this problem, we first perform an analysis of existing models to confirm how gloss annotations make SLT easier. We find that it can provide two aspects of information for the model, 1) it can help the model implicitly learn the location of semantic boundaries in continuous sign language videos, 2) it can help the model understand the sign language video globally. We then propose gloss attention, which enables the model to keep its attention within video segments that have the same semantics locally, just as gloss helps existing models do. Furthermore, we transfer the knowledge of sentence-to-sentence similarity from the natural language model to our gloss attention SLT network (GASLT) to help it understand sign language videos at the sentence level. Experimental results on multiple large-scale sign language datasets show that our proposed GASLT model significantly outperforms existing methods.

Existing neural vocoders designed for text-to-speech cannot directly be applied to singing voice synthesis because they result in glitches and poor high-frequency reconstruction. In this work, we propose SingGAN, a generative adversarial network designed for high-fidelity singing voice synthesis. Specifically, 1) to alleviate the glitch problem in the generated samples, we propose source excitation with the adaptive feature learning filters to expand the receptive field patterns and stabilize long continuous signal generation; and 2) SingGAN introduces global and local discriminators at different scales to enrich low-frequency details and promote high-frequency reconstruction; and 3) To improve the training efficiency, SingGAN includes auxiliary spectrogram losses and sub-band feature matching penalty loss. To the best of our knowledge, SingGAN is the first work designed toward high-fidelity singing voice vocoding. Our evaluation of SingGAN demonstrates the state-of-the-art results with higher-quality (MOS 4.05) samples. Also, SingGAN enables a sample speed of 50x faster than real-time on a single NVIDIA 2080Ti GPU. We further show that SingGAN generalizes well to the mel-spectrogram inversion of unseen singers, and the end-to-end singing voice synthesis system SingGAN-SVS enjoys a two-stage pipeline to transform the music scores into expressive singing voices.

Specifically, due to the low information density of speech data, the transformed discrete speech unit sequence is much longer than the corresponding text transcription, posing significant challenges to existing auto-regressive models. Furthermore, it is not optimal to brutally apply discrete diffusion on the speech unit sequence while disregarding the continuous space structure, which will degrade the generation performance significantly. In this paper, we propose a novel diffusion model by applying the diffusion forward process in the continuous speech representation space, while employing the diffusion backward process in the discrete speech unit space. In this way, we preserve the semantic structure of the continuous speech representation space in the diffusion process and integrate the continuous and discrete diffusion models. We conduct extensive experiments on the textless direct speech-to-speech translation task, where the proposed method achieves comparable results to the computationally intensive auto-regressive baselines (500 steps on average) with significantly fewer decoding steps (50 steps).","['https://openalex.org/W2933138175', 'https://openalex.org/W4287083626', 'https://openalex.org/W2963736842', 'https://openalex.org/W3092028330', 'https://openalex.org/W2963532001', 'https://openalex.org/W3140429000', 'https://openalex.org/W3175871055', 'https://openalex.org/W4287854499', 'https://openalex.org/W2998702515', 'https://openalex.org/W3110257065', 'https://openalex.org/W2136545725', 'https://openalex.org/W4287079508', 'https://openalex.org/W3169320628', 'https://openalex.org/W3015698636', 'https://openalex.org/W3024786184', 'https://openalex.org/W3210177631', 'https://openalex.org/W4312933868', 'https://openalex.org/W3036601975', 'https://openalex.org/W4385571229', 'https://openalex.org/W3172148458', 'https://openalex.org/W4306802991', 'https://openalex.org/W4385572318', 'https://openalex.org/W4300425011', 'https://openalex.org/W4287329820', 'https://openalex.org/W3142316150', 'https://openalex.org/W3107826490', 'https://openalex.org/W2962784628', 'https://openalex.org/W2129069237', 'https://openalex.org/W3213018012', 'https://openalex.org/W4281789500', 'https://openalex.org/W2767206889', 'https://openalex.org/W3007068036', 'https://openalex.org/W3036167779', 'https://openalex.org/W4287072252', 'https://openalex.org/W3119308075', 'https://openalex.org/W4385245566', 'https://openalex.org/W4312051726', 'https://openalex.org/W2972495969', 'https://openalex.org/W3168053944', 'https://openalex.org/W2097203679', 'https://openalex.org/W4372191700', 'https://openalex.org/W4366460484']",2023-01-01

However, the development of high- performing direct S2S models has been critically constrained by the scarcity of large-scale parallel S2S corpora. This survey details Translatotron 3, a pivotal direct S2S system introduced by Google Research in 2023. Translatotron 3 fundamentally shifts the paradigm by demonstrating, for the first time, the feasibility of training a high-quality, end-toend S2S model exclusively using readily available monolingual data resources: source/target speech and source/target text. Leveraging innovative techniques such as unsupervised utterance splitting, phoneme-based intermediate representations, speech-adapted back-translation, and a non auto regressive decoder for rapid inference, Translatotron 3 achieves strong translation quality and remarkable speaker voice preservation without requiring any parallel S2S examples. We critically review the technological context, dissect the model’s architecture and training methodology, analyze its reported performance benchmarks, and discuss its profound implications for advancing S2S translation, particularly for the vast number of low-resource languages previously underserved by data-hungry models.","['https://openalex.org/W2097203679', 'https://openalex.org/W2136545725', 'https://openalex.org/W2936184970', 'https://openalex.org/W4410215894', 'https://openalex.org/W3035707016', 'https://openalex.org/W6810419249', 'https://openalex.org/W4281789500', 'https://openalex.org/W4307006458', 'https://openalex.org/W4223622550', 'https://openalex.org/W4280601369', 'https://openalex.org/W4307932596', 'https://openalex.org/W6798098866', 'https://openalex.org/W3193521535', 'https://openalex.org/W6846857581', 'https://openalex.org/W3169320628', 'https://openalex.org/W6745740328', 'https://openalex.org/W2765961751', 'https://openalex.org/W2284660317', 'https://openalex.org/W2798908575', 'https://openalex.org/W6755567139', 'https://openalex.org/W6798080464', 'https://openalex.org/W2605287558', 'https://openalex.org/W3036601975', 'https://openalex.org/W3205644108', 'https://openalex.org/W4381827575', 'https://openalex.org/W6744957266', 'https://openalex.org/W4378765378']",2025-03-30

However, the shapes of clothing components are complex, and the types are difficult to distinguish. Recent solutions focus on improving datasets and supplying abundant priori information, but the utilization of features by more efficient methods is rarely explored. In this paper, we propose a multi-scale fashion parsing model called the Priori Dictionary Network (PDN), which includes a priori attention module and a multi-scale backbone. The priori attention module extracts high dimensional features from our designed clothing average template as a priori information dictionary (priori dictionary, PD), and the PD is utilized to activate the feature maps of a CNN from a multi-scale attention mechanism. The backbone is derived from classical models, and five side paths are designed to leverage the richer features of local and global contextual representations. To measure the performance of our method, we evaluated the model on four public datasets, the CFPD, UTFR-SBD3, ModaNet and LIP, and the experimental results show that our model stands out from other State of the Art in all four datasets. This method can assist with the labeling problem of clothing datasets.","['https://openalex.org/W2964050021', 'https://openalex.org/W4385337277', 'https://openalex.org/W3035515747', 'https://openalex.org/W3094629174', 'https://openalex.org/W4292513190', 'https://openalex.org/W2156001867', 'https://openalex.org/W1998827347', 'https://openalex.org/W146395692', 'https://openalex.org/W2143085975', 'https://openalex.org/W1002857674', 'https://openalex.org/W2768139823', 'https://openalex.org/W2767370058', 'https://openalex.org/W2811481004', 'https://openalex.org/W2963978393', 'https://openalex.org/W3132190499', 'https://openalex.org/W2788024025', 'https://openalex.org/W4226030517', 'https://openalex.org/W2981959899', 'https://openalex.org/W2999338702', 'https://openalex.org/W2890319229', 'https://openalex.org/W2737106217', 'https://openalex.org/W2937863878', 'https://openalex.org/W2514518917', 'https://openalex.org/W3034509543', 'https://openalex.org/W4366999405', 'https://openalex.org/W3102853147', 'https://openalex.org/W4296068817', 'https://openalex.org/W2047809566', 'https://openalex.org/W2121339428', 'https://openalex.org/W2962974533', 'https://openalex.org/W2986945954', 'https://openalex.org/W2937423351', 'https://openalex.org/W2471768434', 'https://openalex.org/W2808620491', 'https://openalex.org/W1973255633', 'https://openalex.org/W2561228828', 'https://openalex.org/W2990371274', 'https://openalex.org/W2969640942', 'https://openalex.org/W2987738648', 'https://openalex.org/W2902930830', 'https://openalex.org/W3197396971', 'https://openalex.org/W3115879670']",2024-04-22

Actually, even if predicates themselves are balanced, there is still a significant concept-imbalance within them due to the long-tailed distribution of contexts (i.e., subject-object combinations). This concept-level imbalance poses a more pervasive and challenging issue compared to the predicate-level imbalance since subject-object pairs are inherently complex in combinations. To address the issue, we propose Multi-Concept Learning (MCL), a novel concept-level balanced learning framework orthogonal to existing SGG methods. MCL first quantifies the concept-level imbalance across predicates in terms of different amounts of concepts, representing as multiple concept-prototypes within the same class. Then, to achieve balanced learning across different concepts (i.e., concept-prototypes), we introduce the Concept-based Balanced Memory (CBM), which guides SGG models in generating balanced representations for concept-prototypes. Furthermore, the Concept Regularization (CR) technique is proposed to effectively help models in aligning relation features to their corresponding concept-prototypes, thereby generating concept-level compact and predicate-level distinctive representations for robust relation recognition. Finally, we introduce a novel metric, mean Context Recall (mCR@K), as a complement to mean Recall (mR@K), to evaluate the model's performance across concepts (determined by contexts) within the same predicate. Extensive experiments demonstrate the remarkable efficacy of our model-agnostic strategy in enhancing the performance of benchmark models on both VG-SGG and OI-SGG datasets, leading to new state-of-the-art achievements in two key aspects: predicate-level unbiased relation recognition and concept-level compositional generability.

Traditional mitigation methods include re-training from scratch, filtering, or editing; however, these are either computationally expensive or can be circumvented by third parties. In this paper, we take a different approach and study how to post-edit an already-trained conditional generative model so that it redacts certain conditionals that will, with high probability, lead to undesirable content. This is done by distilling the conditioning network in the models, giving a solution that is effective, efficient, controllable, and universal for a class of deep generative models. We conduct experiments on redacting prompts in text-to-image models and redacting voices in text-to-speech models. Our method is computationally light, leads to better redaction quality and robustness than baseline methods while still retaining high generation quality.","['https://openalex.org/W4312933868', 'https://openalex.org/W6790978476', 'https://openalex.org/W6809885388', 'https://openalex.org/W6849119191', 'https://openalex.org/W6783182287', 'https://openalex.org/W6838843145', 'https://openalex.org/W6850625674', 'https://openalex.org/W6810940779', 'https://openalex.org/W6802142950', 'https://openalex.org/W6846007759', 'https://openalex.org/W6845894799', 'https://openalex.org/W6848735303', 'https://openalex.org/W6850334629', 'https://openalex.org/W6747945526', 'https://openalex.org/W2982756474', 'https://openalex.org/W6783036129', 'https://openalex.org/W3100355250', 'https://openalex.org/W3184144760', 'https://openalex.org/W4385894687', 'https://openalex.org/W4220993274', 'https://openalex.org/W4386066536', 'https://openalex.org/W4378977315', 'https://openalex.org/W2966792645', 'https://openalex.org/W3106976604', 'https://openalex.org/W1488996941', 'https://openalex.org/W6769833289', 'https://openalex.org/W6775408278', 'https://openalex.org/W6780547051', 'https://openalex.org/W6791907524', 'https://openalex.org/W6790532531', 'https://openalex.org/W6791392103', 'https://openalex.org/W3154155772', 'https://openalex.org/W3193974325', 'https://openalex.org/W4387171800', 'https://openalex.org/W2961363059', 'https://openalex.org/W6779823529', 'https://openalex.org/W4312872987', 'https://openalex.org/W6841366371', 'https://openalex.org/W4386057725', 'https://openalex.org/W4385271134', 'https://openalex.org/W6846547581', 'https://openalex.org/W6784843700', 'https://openalex.org/W6789034737', 'https://openalex.org/W3177399056', 'https://openalex.org/W4390871724', 'https://openalex.org/W4394593019', 'https://openalex.org/W6851248805', 'https://openalex.org/W6852699082', 'https://openalex.org/W4390874260', 'https://openalex.org/W6840815571', 'https://openalex.org/W6678815747', 'https://openalex.org/W6600609147', 'https://openalex.org/W2398118205', 'https://openalex.org/W2963966654', 'https://openalex.org/W2937579788', 'https://openalex.org/W6847363464', 'https://openalex.org/W6631190155', 'https://openalex.org/W6718379498', 'https://openalex.org/W2183341477', 'https://openalex.org/W3107235539', 'https://openalex.org/W6917585676', 'https://openalex.org/W2972359262', 'https://openalex.org/W2141998673', 'https://openalex.org/W1565144712', 'https://openalex.org/W2125324924', 'https://openalex.org/W6855790366', 'https://openalex.org/W3035574324', 'https://openalex.org/W1522301498', 'https://openalex.org/W4311431699', 'https://openalex.org/W3035556513', 'https://openalex.org/W4289785045', 'https://openalex.org/W4287627508', 'https://openalex.org/W2783792814', 'https://openalex.org/W4306820534', 'https://openalex.org/W3013335600', 'https://openalex.org/W4322718191', 'https://openalex.org/W3203737321', 'https://openalex.org/W4402916987', 'https://openalex.org/W3040639636', 'https://openalex.org/W4288099666', 'https://openalex.org/W2125389028', 'https://openalex.org/W3086249591', 'https://openalex.org/W3036167779', 'https://openalex.org/W4224035735', 'https://openalex.org/W4385901090', 'https://openalex.org/W4323651091', 'https://openalex.org/W2963373786', 'https://openalex.org/W4305001257', 'https://openalex.org/W4226125322', 'https://openalex.org/W3122887115', 'https://openalex.org/W4377111763', 'https://openalex.org/W4317951215', 'https://openalex.org/W3135378441', 'https://openalex.org/W4311000453', 'https://openalex.org/W4313679638', 'https://openalex.org/W4320013936']",2024-04-09

The project’s primary objective is the development of chatbot capable of responding to farmers’ text queries in Darija, providing them with instant access to critical agricultural information and support. Concurrently, we have curated an extensive database of Darija agricultural terminology, phrases, and dialogues, laying the groundwork for future voice-enabled interactions. Throughout the project, we have conducted thorough research into Darija linguistics and agricultural practices, followed by an in-depth development phase of the chatbot system. This included natural language processing, intent recognition, and response generation tailored to the nuances of Darija. The database curation involved extensive collaboration with agricultural experts to ensure authenticity and relevance. Looking forward, this project serves as a crucial stepping stone towards a fully voice-enabled agricultural support system in Darija. The curated database will be instrumental in fine-tuning STT and TTS models, potentially revolutionizing how Moroccan farmers access and interact with digital agricultural resources.","['https://openalex.org/W2037901597', 'https://openalex.org/W2907049732', 'https://openalex.org/W3003261680', 'https://openalex.org/W3006588924', 'https://openalex.org/W2806962830', 'https://openalex.org/W2788269531', 'https://openalex.org/W4387048877', 'https://openalex.org/W4323651091', 'https://openalex.org/W4372260088', 'https://openalex.org/W4382603054', 'https://openalex.org/W4389500133']",2024-01-01

With the development of neural networks, end-to-end audio codecs have emerged and demonstrated effects beyond conventional codecs. However, current neural network-based codecs have the weakness of high computational complexity, and the performance of these methods decreases rapidly after decreasing the complexity, which is not conducive to deployment under low computational resources. In this paper, a low-complexity audio codec is proposed. To realize the low complexity of the model with high quality, a structure based on frequency band division is designed, which is implemented using a within bandacross band interaction (WBABI) module to learn the features across and within the subband. Further, we propose a new quantization-compensation module, which reduces the quantization error by 90%. The experimental results show that for audio with a sample rate of 24kHz, the model shows excellent performance at 3~6kbps compared to other codecs, and the complexity is only 0.8 Giga Multiply-Add Operations per Second(GMACs).","['https://openalex.org/W3215615641', 'https://openalex.org/W3188073270', 'https://openalex.org/W3163662330', 'https://openalex.org/W2972519044', 'https://openalex.org/W6783867762', 'https://openalex.org/W6767111847', 'https://openalex.org/W4297841527', 'https://openalex.org/W3015338123', 'https://openalex.org/W4297841531', 'https://openalex.org/W1901129140', 'https://openalex.org/W2752796333', 'https://openalex.org/W6762931180', 'https://openalex.org/W4307323391', 'https://openalex.org/W4284972581', 'https://openalex.org/W4225287045', 'https://openalex.org/W6852581948', 'https://openalex.org/W4375869380', 'https://openalex.org/W3144035034', 'https://openalex.org/W2064675550', 'https://openalex.org/W6785090365', 'https://openalex.org/W2998572311', 'https://openalex.org/W2972359262', 'https://openalex.org/W3037038648', 'https://openalex.org/W2970006822', 'https://openalex.org/W4372279529', 'https://openalex.org/W2963799213', 'https://openalex.org/W3094002217', 'https://openalex.org/W4212774754', 'https://openalex.org/W3092028330']",2024-03-18

The technique used was the analysis of digital image files and as an instrument a double input matrix, where the conversions of BMP files to six different extensions of image files were registered, with four different tools for manipulation of image files. The experimental design was factorial, where the two factors were the image compression formats and tools and the dependent variable the final image file size. Factorial ANOVA statistical analysis was applied with a = 0.05. It was obtained that the format of smaller size was the JPG when using as tool the Illustrator and the one of greater size the one of greater extension the PSD also obtained with the Illustrator. The statistical analysis showed that the format factor significantly influences the final size of the images (p &lt; 0.05) and the tool factor does not show significant influence on the size of the images (p &gt; 0.05), nor is the interaction between the factors significant. It is concluded that regardless of the tool used, it is the image format that influences the final size.","['https://openalex.org/W4392672786', 'https://openalex.org/W2998600732', 'https://openalex.org/W2614571092', 'https://openalex.org/W2268076750', 'https://openalex.org/W1513626946', 'https://openalex.org/W2188519435', 'https://openalex.org/W2964122515', 'https://openalex.org/W2569234446', 'https://openalex.org/W3034008104', 'https://openalex.org/W2106648736', 'https://openalex.org/W2148685281', 'https://openalex.org/W2517064760', 'https://openalex.org/W2766934651', 'https://openalex.org/W2622645257', 'https://openalex.org/W2187490662', 'https://openalex.org/W2186446247', 'https://openalex.org/W2316556732', 'https://openalex.org/W2914628419', 'https://openalex.org/W3178376550', 'https://openalex.org/W4214692777', 'https://openalex.org/W4367721819', 'https://openalex.org/W4380551955']",2025-01-10
https://openalex.org/W3168542456,https://doi.org/10.1109/taslp.2021.3076369,Expressive TTS Training With Frame and Style Reconstruction Loss,"We propose a novel training strategy for Tacotron-based text-to-speech (TTS) system that improves the speech styling at utterance level. One of the key challenges in prosody modeling is the lack of reference that makes explicit modeling difficult. The proposed technique doesn't require prosody annotations from training data. It doesn't attempt to model prosody explicitly either, but rather encodes the association between input text and its prosody styles using a Tacotron-based TTS framework. This study marks a departure from the style token paradigm where prosody is explicitly modeled by a bank of prosody embeddings. It adopts a combination of two objective functions: 1) frame level reconstruction loss, that is calculated between the synthesized and target spectral features; 2) utterance level style reconstruction loss, that is calculated between the deep style features of synthesized and target speech. The style reconstruction loss is formulated as a perceptual loss to ensure that utterance level speech style is taken into consideration during training. Experiments show that the proposed training strategy achieves remarkable performance and outperforms the state-of-the-art baseline in both naturalness and expressiveness. To our best knowledge, this is the first study to incorporate utterance level perceptual quality as a loss function into Tacotron training for improved expressiveness.","['https://openalex.org/W2963522749', 'https://openalex.org/W2331128040', 'https://openalex.org/W2795109282', 'https://openalex.org/W2885800352', 'https://openalex.org/W6750489868',

However, the prosody and controllability of the generated speech is still insufficient, especially in tonal languages. Moreover, the generated prosody is solely defined by the input text, which does not allow for different styles for the same sentence or words. In this study, we extended Tacotron2 with a pitch prediction task to capture discrete pitch-related representations. Specifically, the learned pitch-related suprasegmental information is fed simultaneously with traditional character features into the decoder to generate final Mel spectrogram. Experiments show that the proposed method can improve the quality of the generated speech (mean opinion score of 4.37 vs. 4.22). Moreover, we demonstrated that we can easily achieve word-level pitch control during generation by changing local pitch-related representations before passing them to the decoder network.","['https://openalex.org/W6762643587', 'https://openalex.org/W2795109282', 'https://openalex.org/W6750489868', 'https://openalex.org/W2962691331', 'https://openalex.org/W3097892637', 'https://openalex.org/W2964138190', 'https://openalex.org/W3016021263', 'https://openalex.org/W2885800352', 'https://openalex.org/W2963091184', 'https://openalex.org/W3016007107', 'https://openalex.org/W2963945466', 'https://openalex.org/W2935711438', 'https://openalex.org/W3015440759', 'https://openalex.org/W3100270690', 'https://openalex.org/W2972849140', 'https://openalex.org/W6736996214', 'https://openalex.org/W2964243274', 'https://openalex.org/W3094917204', 'https://openalex.org/W3015419784', 'https://openalex.org/W3010916717', 'https://openalex.org/W6690026940', 'https://openalex.org/W2091425152', 'https://openalex.org/W2952269766', 'https://openalex.org/W2963272440', 'https://openalex.org/W2963609956', 'https://openalex.org/W4295731579', 'https://openalex.org/W2963927338', 'https://openalex.org/W3086296097', 'https://openalex.org/W2242818861', 'https://openalex.org/W2794490148', 'https://openalex.org/W2945544731', 'https://openalex.org/W2519091744', 'https://openalex.org/W3125709657']",2021-05-13

In this paper, we study the disentanglement and recomposition of emotional elements in speech through variational autoencoding Wasserstein generative adversarial network (VAW-GAN). We propose a speaker-dependent EVC framework based on VAW-GAN, that includes two VAW-GAN pipelines, one for spectrum conversion, and another for prosody conversion. We train a spectral encoder that disentangles emotion and prosody (F0) information from spectral features; we also train a prosodic encoder that disentangles emotion modulation of prosody (affective prosody) from linguistic prosody. At run-time, the decoder of spectral VAW-GAN is conditioned on the output of prosodic VAW-GAN. The vocoder takes the converted spectral and prosodic features to generate the target emotional speech.

In particular, it divides the latent representation into two parts with the same dimensions. We utilize two different quantizers to quantize the low-dimensional features and the residual between the low- and high-dimensional features. Meanwhile, we propose a dual attention module in split-residual vector quantization to improve information sharing along both dimensions.

The lack of added delay allows it to be integrated into the Opus codec, and we demonstrate that it enables effective wideband encoding for bitrates down to 6 kb/s.","['https://openalex.org/W4284972581', 'https://openalex.org/W3215615641', 'https://openalex.org/W6695676441', 'https://openalex.org/W4375869380', 'https://openalex.org/W3163662330', 'https://openalex.org/W2972519044', 'https://openalex.org/W2809824582', 'https://openalex.org/W2131094339', 'https://openalex.org/W6778625279', 'https://openalex.org/W6779192484', 'https://openalex.org/W3028785944', 'https://openalex.org/W2895654193', 'https://openalex.org/W3198020407', 'https://openalex.org/W3092791109', 'https://openalex.org/W6777781272', 'https://openalex.org/W2750167318', 'https://openalex.org/W6778672582', 'https://openalex.org/W6634531052', 'https://openalex.org/W6846849147', 'https://openalex.org/W6639363673', 'https://openalex.org/W4226360164', 'https://openalex.org/W6762390287', 'https://openalex.org/W4225860133', 'https://openalex.org/W3016057201', 'https://openalex.org/W4310630515', 'https://openalex.org/W3030374183', 'https://openalex.org/W1973746598', 'https://openalex.org/W4205788663', 'https://openalex.org/W2284050935', 'https://openalex.org/W3032479101', 'https://openalex.org/W3028954259', 'https://openalex.org/W3096468295', 'https://openalex.org/W3032558098']",2023-09-15
https://openalex.org/W4409222133,https://doi.org/10.15622/ia.24.2.3,An AudioCodec Based on the Perceptual Equality between the Original and Restored Audio Signals,"A method for lossy audio data compression (AudioCodec) is presented. It allows for improving objective quality of the restored audio signal by 25% at a bitrate of 390 kbps and 55% at a bitrate of 64 kbps compared to the AAC MPEG-4 format. The proposed method of audio data compression is based on an advanced theory of lossy audio data compression (TLAC), which is also introduced in the article. The improvement in the objective quality of the reconstructed audio signal (according to the standardized PEAQ measure) is achieved because the TLAC overcomes issues in modern lossy audio data compression methods related to the use of psychoacoustic principles of human sound perception, including after overcoming the ""psychoacoustic compression limit"" of the audio signal (i.e. the moment in perceptual coding when the available bit budget is insufficient to encode all spectral components with the accuracy required from a psychoacoustic perspective). This allows for achieving perceptual equality between the original and reconstructed audio signals. As an analysis of the state of the art, solutions for both lossless and lossy audio data compression, as well as those using artificial intelligence, are considered. In all modern lossy audio data compression methods, the procedure for selecting the spectral components to be preserved, as well as the permissible quantization error, is carried out through a series of highly complex procedures collectively referred to as the ""psychoacoustic model of the lossy audio compression method"". In a strict sense, perceptual equality between the spectra of the original and restored signals has not been proven by any research group and, therefore, cannot be guaranteed by them. Independent experts regularly publish tests demonstrating that modern audio codecs have issues with certain audio signals. The article proposes an AudioCodec based on the perceptual equality between the original and restored audio signals, which is based on the new ideas of the theory of lossy audio compression (TLAC). These ideas guarantee the achievement of perceptual equality between the original and restored audio signals at different bitrates, therefore, the AudioCodec built on its basis is free from the above-mentioned issues and, as a result, significantly outperforms modern AudioCodecs in terms of the objective quality of the restored audio signal, as measured by PEAQ.","['https://openalex.org/W2585155455', 'https://openalex.org/W4375869380', 'https://openalex.org/W4392903897', 'https://openalex.org/W4221152438', 'https://openalex.org/W4297841815', 'https://openalex.org/W2963091184', 'https://openalex.org/W4225290925', 'https://openalex.org/W4372190822', 'https://openalex.org/W3215615641', 'https://openalex.org/W4392903389']",2025-04-01

Both during training and during recognition, they require a mapping table, called the dictionary, which maps words into sequences of these subword units. The performance of the LVCSR system depends critically on the definition of the subword units and the accuracy of the dictionary. In current LVCSR systems, both these components are manually designed. While manually designed subword units generalize well, they may not be the optimal units of classification for the specific task or environment for which an LVCSR system is trained. Moreover, when human expertise is not available, it may not be possible to design good subword units manually. There is clearly a need for data-driven design of these LVCSR components. In this paper, we present a complete probabilistic formulation for the automatic design of subword units and dictionary, given only the acoustic data and their transcriptions. The proposed framework permits easy incorporation of external sources of information, such as the spellings of words in terms of a nonideographic script.","['https://openalex.org/W2128780426', 'https://openalex.org/W189838809', 'https://openalex.org/W2137919556', 'https://openalex.org/W2158598479', 'https://openalex.org/W1964917299', 'https://openalex.org/W1949782964', 'https://openalex.org/W1763005514', 'https://openalex.org/W17875541', 'https://openalex.org/W1865025591', 'https://openalex.org/W77847722', 'https://openalex.org/W2049633694', 'https://openalex.org/W2156530815', 'https://openalex.org/W2134237567', 'https://openalex.org/W2998215494', 'https://openalex.org/W2142401923', 'https://openalex.org/W1643320849', 'https://openalex.org/W1965201650', 'https://openalex.org/W2144639996', 'https://openalex.org/W1560013842', 'https://openalex.org/W2002089154', 'https://openalex.org/W4302339081', 'https://openalex.org/W2006969979', 'https://openalex.org/W2160645305']",2002-01-01

These domains are typically Digitized in binary files like Images, Audio, and Videos. The translation, recognition and synthesis are required while understating the meaning of the binary content. The recognition process is also having many problems in case of audio processing. The missing context is the major reason in pattern-based matching. This is due to unclear or low-quality input, as well as training model on different frequencies but by using context some of the accuracy may improve. Context finding from binary files is a challenge as it works in temporal and space domain. Binary data like images contain special information, while audio files contain temporal information. Video files have both time and space domains. Updating context in the temporal domain, to find proper context from the audio corpus, speech recognition is applied. Over the time period, there are different models adapted like Hidden Markov Model (HMM), Rule Based models with fuzzy support, pattern-based models including machine learning techniques K-nearest neighbor, Support Vector Machine, also latest techniques like Artificial Neural Network (ANN). These technologies are typically included in Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR). ASR uses Language resources with any one of the above models. Here, an in-depth survey on ASR and available APIs.

Thus the baseforms describing the vocabulary words in terms of the recognition units need to be generated from training data.

A mapping between the orthographic form and phonetic forms representing the pronunciation is thus required. This may be obtained by creating pronunciation lexica and/or rule-based systems for grapheme-to-phoneme conversion. Traditionally, this mapping has been obtained manually, based on phonetic and linguistic knowledge. This approach has a number of drawbacks: i) the pronunciations represent typical pronunciations and will have a limited capacity for describing pronunciation variation due to speaking style and dialectical/accent variations; ii) if multiple pronunciation variants are included, it does not indicate which variants are more significant for the specific application; iii) the description is based on phonetic-knowledge and does not take into account that the units used in speech technology may deviate from the phonetic interpretation; and iv) the description is limited to units with a linguistic interpretation.

The first design is based on the &amp;apos;Separate Segmentation &amp;amp; Labelling &amp;apos; (SS&amp;amp;L) approach. The spectral data of the input utterance is first segmented into phoneme-like units which are then time normalised by linear time normalisation. The neural network labels the time-normalised phoneme-like segments./8.36 % recognition accuracy is achieved for the phoneme-like unit. In the second design, no time no-malisation is required. After segmentation, recognition is performed by classifying the data in a window as it is slid one frame at a time, from the start to the end of of each phoneme-like segment in the utterance. 73.97 % recognition accuracy for the phoneme-like unit is achieved in this application. The parameters of the neural net have been optimised for maximum recognition performance. A segmentation strategy using the sum of the difference in filterbank channel energy over successive spectra produced 80.27 % correct segmentation of isolated utterances into phoneme-like units. A linguistic processor based on that of Kashyap &amp;amp; Mittal [84] enables 93.11 % and 93.49 % word recognition accuracy to be achieved for the SS&amp;amp;L and &amp;apos;Sliding Window &amp;apos; recognisers respectively.

In the first stage, the unlabelled speech is decoded into a sequence of subword units that are learned and modelled in an unsupervised manner. In the second stage, partial sequence matching and clustering are performed on the decoded subword sequences, resulting in a set of discovered words or phrases. A limitation of this approach is that the results of subword decoding could be erroneous, and the errors would impact the subsequent steps. While Siamese/Triplet network is one approach to learn segment representations that can improve the discovery process, the challenge in spoken term discovery under a complete unsupervised scenario is that training examples are unavailable. In this paper, we propose to generate training examples from initial hypothesized sequence clusters. The Siamese/Triplet network is trained on the hypothesized examples to measure the similarity between two speech segments and hereby perform re-clustering of all hypothesized subword sequences to achieve spoken term discovery. Experimental results show that the proposed approach is effective in obtaining training examples for Siamese and Triplet networks, improving the efficacy of spoken term discovery as compared with the original two-stage method.","['https://openalex.org/W3095049654', 'https://openalex.org/W2786608204', 'https://openalex.org/W3095433102', 'https://openalex.org/W2078769636', 'https://openalex.org/W2913062184', 'https://openalex.org/W2963620343', 'https://openalex.org/W2972794572', 'https://openalex.org/W2964169922', 'https://openalex.org/W2748394715', 'https://openalex.org/W2100736366', 'https://openalex.org/W2009388533', 'https://openalex.org/W2127589108', 'https://openalex.org/W151377110', 'https://openalex.org/W2057007397', 'https://openalex.org/W1957665339', 'https://openalex.org/W4289564011', 'https://openalex.org/W2963775347', 'https://openalex.org/W2118841860', 'https://openalex.org/W2190506272', 'https://openalex.org/W3091905774', 'https://openalex.org/W1949782964', 'https://openalex.org/W2889270419']",2020-11-28

Used in a speaker independent mode the recognizer is slightly inferior to a corresponding whole-word based recognizer.","['https://openalex.org/W1957665339', 'https://openalex.org/W2032474878', 'https://openalex.org/W2134383396', 'https://openalex.org/W1949782964']",1989-01-01

Previous methods have limitations such as the limited scope of audio types (e.g., music, speech) and specific bandwidth settings they can handle (e.g., 4 kHz to 8 kHz). In this paper, we introduce a diffusion-based generative model, AudioSR, that is capable of performing robust audio super-resolution on versatile audio types, including sound effects, music, and speech. Specifically, AudioSR can upsample any input audio signal within the bandwidth range of 2 kHz to 16 kHz to a high-resolution audio signal at 24 kHz bandwidth with a sampling rate of 48 kHz. Extensive objective evaluation on various audio super-resolution benchmarks demonstrates the strong result achieved by the proposed model. In addition, our subjective evaluation shows that AudioSR can act as a plug-and-play module to enhance the generation quality of a wide range of audio generative models, including AudioLDM, Fastspeech2, and MusicGen.

To address this, we propose the Music Understanding LLaMA (MU-LLaMA), capable of answering music-related questions and generating captions for music files. Our model utilizes audio representations from a pretrained MERT model to extract music features. However, obtaining a suitable dataset for training the MU-LLaMA model remains challenging, as existing publicly accessible audio question answering datasets lack the necessary depth for open-ended music question answering. To fill this gap, we present a methodology for generating question-answer pairs from existing audio captioning datasets and introduce the MusicQA Dataset designed for answering open-ended music-related questions. The experiments demonstrate that the proposed MU-LLaMA model, trained on our designed MusicQA dataset, achieves outstanding performance in both music question answering and music caption generation across various metrics, outperforming current state-of-the-art (SOTA) models in both fields and offering a promising advancement in the T2M-Gen research field.","['https://openalex.org/W6853096648', 'https://openalex.org/W6776218486', 'https://openalex.org/W6849517043', 'https://openalex.org/W6849105126', 'https://openalex.org/W3201326582', 'https://openalex.org/W6798955355', 'https://openalex.org/W6855932524', 'https://openalex.org/W6851948999', 'https://openalex.org/W6853249747', 'https://openalex.org/W4386071707', 'https://openalex.org/W6850625674', 'https://openalex.org/W6854866820', 'https://openalex.org/W4292794290', 'https://openalex.org/W6678969435', 'https://openalex.org/W6798597329', 'https://openalex.org/W2939574508', 'https://openalex.org/W4372260310', 'https://openalex.org/W4284898017', 'https://openalex.org/W6791353385', 'https://openalex.org/W6853393314', 'https://openalex.org/W6811051256', 'https://openalex.org/W6763945542', 'https://openalex.org/W6898505805', 'https://openalex.org/W6678262379', 'https://openalex.org/W6682631176', 'https://openalex.org/W6761205521', 'https://openalex.org/W6852489829', 'https://openalex.org/W4380136719', 'https://openalex.org/W4379251869', 'https://openalex.org/W4361229539', 'https://openalex.org/W4322718191', 'https://openalex.org/W4318351475', 'https://openalex.org/W4385474092', 'https://openalex.org/W2950060770', 'https://openalex.org/W4226358929', 'https://openalex.org/W2936695845', 'https://openalex.org/W4367628410', 'https://openalex.org/W3180663620', 'https://openalex.org/W4384918448', 'https://openalex.org/W3185739472', 'https://openalex.org/W4377130946', 'https://openalex.org/W4287802874', 'https://openalex.org/W2154652894']",2024-03-18

Motivated by recent advances in the computer vision domain, we are the first to explore the combination of pre-trained text-to-audio diffusers with two established personalization methods. We experiment with the effect of audio-specific data augmentation on the overall system performance and assess different training strategies. For evaluation, we construct a novel dataset with prompts and music clips. We consider both embedding-based and music-specific metrics for quantitative evaluation, as well as a user study for qualitative evaluation. Our analysis shows that similarity metrics are in accordance with user preferences and that current personalization approaches tend to learn rhythmic music concepts more easily than melody.

Despite this progress, the synergy between these two domains remains underexplored. Consequently, we introduce a novel method for text-to-music generation, capitalizing on the precise control over specific musical attributes provided by symbolic music models and the ability of audio music models to generate music coherent with the contextual meaning of input text. This method enhances the alignment between the generated music and the input text. Specifically, the proposed method initiates by generating symbolic music from input text, which is then transformed into audio music. Ultimately, music conditioned on the input text and the transformed audio music is generated. The experiments demonstrate that the proposed method produces music more aligned with the input text compared to individual models. Moreover, the method proves particularly effective in generating music lasting between 30 to 74 seconds, and shows consistency improvement on individual models under variable input text lengths.","['https://openalex.org/W4286250570', 'https://openalex.org/W2250539671', 'https://openalex.org/W6682691769', 'https://openalex.org/W6769627184', 'https://openalex.org/W4372260310', 'https://openalex.org/W1965419851', 'https://openalex.org/W4377140494', 'https://openalex.org/W6739901393', 'https://openalex.org/W3213549365', 'https://openalex.org/W4376607936', 'https://openalex.org/W4379251846', 'https://openalex.org/W4320342491', 'https://openalex.org/W4380136719', 'https://openalex.org/W4288089799', 'https://openalex.org/W2896457183', 'https://openalex.org/W1959608418', 'https://openalex.org/W4307323391', 'https://openalex.org/W4293575120', 'https://openalex.org/W4294170691', 'https://openalex.org/W4318351475', 'https://openalex.org/W4309801653', 'https://openalex.org/W4318718630', 'https://openalex.org/W4385245566']",2023-10-27

Long before recent advances, similar questions have been pondered without definitive answers. We argue that the true potential of generative AI lies in cultivating musical discovery, expanding our individual and collective musical horizons. We outline a vision for systems that nurture human creativity, learning, and community. To contend with the richness of music in such contexts, we believe machines will need a kind of musical common sense comprising structural, emotional, and sociocultural factors.

We discuss possible models and strategies for developing new discovery-focused musical tools, drawing on past and ongoing work in our research group ranging from the individual to the community scale.

This study explores how voice type and contribution quality influence human–agent team performance and perceptions of anthropomorphism, animacy, intelligence, and trustworthiness. By manipulating both, we reveal mechanisms of perception and clarify ambiguity in previous work. Our results show that the human resemblance of a voice assistant’s voice negatively interacts with the helpfulness of an agent’s contribution to flip its effect on perceived anthropomorphism and perceived animacy. This means human teammates interpret the agent’s contributions differently depending on its voice. Our study found no significant effect of voice on perceived intelligence, trustworthiness, or team performance. We find differences in these measures are caused by manipulating the helpfulness of an agent. These findings suggest that function matters more than form when designing agents for high-performing human–agent teams, but controlling perceptions of anthropomorphism and animacy can be unpredictable even with high human resemblance.","['https://openalex.org/W4283641801', 'https://openalex.org/W4214810114', 'https://openalex.org/W2029308871', 'https://openalex.org/W2164725482', 'https://openalex.org/W2032568497', 'https://openalex.org/W3135619344', 'https://openalex.org/W6637623960', 'https://openalex.org/W6680920554', 'https://openalex.org/W2920996501', 'https://openalex.org/W2986334266', 'https://openalex.org/W6803368495', 'https://openalex.org/W6853096648', 'https://openalex.org/W6748398305', 'https://openalex.org/W2734963796', 'https://openalex.org/W2005401218', 'https://openalex.org/W2499526086', 'https://openalex.org/W1991044014', 'https://openalex.org/W3207331896', 'https://openalex.org/W2010158189', 'https://openalex.org/W2574287525', 'https://openalex.org/W2115040353', 'https://openalex.org/W2155246433', 'https://openalex.org/W3200832617', 'https://openalex.org/W3216249220', 'https://openalex.org/W4367550478', 'https://openalex.org/W4231399809', 'https://openalex.org/W3006245018', 'https://openalex.org/W2135907989', 'https://openalex.org/W6654516771', 'https://openalex.org/W3127356397', 'https://openalex.org/W2024320470', 'https://openalex.org/W2225036064', 'https://openalex.org/W2062585762', 'https://openalex.org/W3036668652', 'https://openalex.org/W2026272086', 'https://openalex.org/W6679396994', 'https://openalex.org/W2972387638', 'https://openalex.org/W4243342770', 'https://openalex.org/W2058624789', 'https://openalex.org/W2141373701', 'https://openalex.org/W1975950487', 'https://openalex.org/W2136407476', 'https://openalex.org/W2770836081', 'https://openalex.org/W2620350838', 'https://openalex.org/W2035546865', 'https://openalex.org/W3034161046', 'https://openalex.org/W2620920482', 'https://openalex.org/W1991015565', 'https://openalex.org/W4362588460', 'https://openalex.org/W6804085326', 'https://openalex.org/W2314033003', 'https://openalex.org/W2063052894', 'https://openalex.org/W3123303846', 'https://openalex.org/W3163271954', 'https://openalex.org/W2039376592', 'https://openalex.org/W4205928526', 'https://openalex.org/W3216894215', 'https://openalex.org/W2164171543', 'https://openalex.org/W2517471910', 'https://openalex.org/W3159367349', 'https://openalex.org/W3187653187', 'https://openalex.org/W4212899454', 'https://openalex.org/W2274175710', 'https://openalex.org/W2912159753', 'https://openalex.org/W6760868126', 'https://openalex.org/W2991175618', 'https://openalex.org/W2557592112', 'https://openalex.org/W6842428671', 'https://openalex.org/W3009578469', 'https://openalex.org/W2942157335', 'https://openalex.org/W3120142301', 'https://openalex.org/W4380136719', 'https://openalex.org/W4295124108', 'https://openalex.org/W4241818697', 'https://openalex.org/W2926006265', 'https://openalex.org/W2017180264', 'https://openalex.org/W4382239349', 'https://openalex.org/W3205692592']",2024-08-01

Nevertheless, previous VAEs still encounter issues with overly long feature sequences and generated results lack contextual coherence, thus the challenge of modeling long multi-track symbolic music still remains unaddressed. To this end, we propose Multi-view MidiVAE, as one of the pioneers in VAE methods that effectively model and generate long multi-track symbolic music. The Multi-view MidiVAE utilizes the two-dimensional (2-D) representation, OctupleMIDI, to capture relationships among notes while reducing the feature sequences length. Moreover, we focus on instrumental characteristics and harmony as well as global and local information about the musical composition by employing a hybrid variational encoding-decoding strategy to integrate both Track- and Bar-view MidiVAE features. Objective and subjective experimental results on the CocoChorales dataset demonstrate that, compared to the baseline, Multi-view MidiVAE exhibits significant improvements in terms of modeling long multi-track symbolic music.","['https://openalex.org/W6855691466', 'https://openalex.org/W3092850823', 'https://openalex.org/W2772474126', 'https://openalex.org/W4372259826', 'https://openalex.org/W6760601182', 'https://openalex.org/W6765759998', 'https://openalex.org/W6849105126', 'https://openalex.org/W6849109464', 'https://openalex.org/W6853096648', 'https://openalex.org/W6852824296', 'https://openalex.org/W6849635556', 'https://openalex.org/W6852971826', 'https://openalex.org/W6852872555', 'https://openalex.org/W6749351710', 'https://openalex.org/W2963253162', 'https://openalex.org/W3048062783', 'https://openalex.org/W6782288222', 'https://openalex.org/W6810995942', 'https://openalex.org/W6793578827', 'https://openalex.org/W6751598888', 'https://openalex.org/W2963408210', 'https://openalex.org/W3173187964', 'https://openalex.org/W4385245566', 'https://openalex.org/W6844035133', 'https://openalex.org/W6744627333', 'https://openalex.org/W4221148975', 'https://openalex.org/W2805697608', 'https://openalex.org/W4378499140', 'https://openalex.org/W4287250916', 'https://openalex.org/W4378942405', 'https://openalex.org/W4298182583', 'https://openalex.org/W4380136719', 'https://openalex.org/W4377140494', 'https://openalex.org/W4318351475', 'https://openalex.org/W4318752004', 'https://openalex.org/W4319989813', 'https://openalex.org/W4385328213']",2024-03-18

However, the development of deep network algorithms using event cameras has been slow because of the lack of large labelled event camera datasets for network training. This paper reports a method for creating new labelled event datasets by using a text-to-X model, where X is one or multiple output modalities, in the case of this work, events. Our proposed text-to-events model produces synthetic event frames directly from text prompts. It uses an autoencoder which is trained to produce sparse event frames representing event camera outputs. By combining the pretrained autoencoder with a diffusion model architecture, the new text-to-events model is able to generate smooth synthetic event streams of moving objects. The autoencoder was first trained on an event camera dataset of diverse scenes. In the combined training with the diffusion model, the DVS gesture dataset was used. We demonstrate that the model can generate realistic event sequences of human gestures prompted by different text statements. The classification accuracy of the generated sequences, using a classifier trained on the real dataset, ranges between 42% to 92%, depending on the gesture group. The results demonstrate the capability of this method in synthesizing event datasets.","['https://openalex.org/W2016574277', 'https://openalex.org/W2968243907', 'https://openalex.org/W4283753774', 'https://openalex.org/W2757430550', 'https://openalex.org/W3035212231', 'https://openalex.org/W4386076494', 'https://openalex.org/W4312280868', 'https://openalex.org/W3009453333', 'https://openalex.org/W4229060330', 'https://openalex.org/W4293756458', 'https://openalex.org/W6967576201', 'https://openalex.org/W4387300055', 'https://openalex.org/W4390993582', 'https://openalex.org/W4402915744', 'https://openalex.org/W2745933219', 'https://openalex.org/W2425121537', 'https://openalex.org/W2567239141', 'https://openalex.org/W3095334530', 'https://openalex.org/W3196480172', 'https://openalex.org/W6755494875', 'https://openalex.org/W6856129569', 'https://openalex.org/W3188021906', 'https://openalex.org/W3034469298', 'https://openalex.org/W6855339026', 'https://openalex.org/W3114635118', 'https://openalex.org/W6783508657', 'https://openalex.org/W6679045638', 'https://openalex.org/W6779823529', 'https://openalex.org/W4387195417', 'https://openalex.org/W4360884927', 'https://openalex.org/W6853096648', 'https://openalex.org/W4390874263', 'https://openalex.org/W4390873550', 'https://openalex.org/W6809885388', 'https://openalex.org/W4312933868', 'https://openalex.org/W4386065764', 'https://openalex.org/W6856700853', 'https://openalex.org/W6845281891', 'https://openalex.org/W3176481196', 'https://openalex.org/W4312614039', 'https://openalex.org/W4386076661', 'https://openalex.org/W4390872862', 'https://openalex.org/W3191528047', 'https://openalex.org/W4308235769', 'https://openalex.org/W4292787316', 'https://openalex.org/W4390873758', 'https://openalex.org/W2998281665', 'https://openalex.org/W4386076324', 'https://openalex.org/W6792408638', 'https://openalex.org/W6758151150', 'https://openalex.org/W4304891868', 'https://openalex.org/W6851907563', 'https://openalex.org/W3147919432', 'https://openalex.org/W4390872297', 'https://openalex.org/W6838639034', 'https://openalex.org/W6840815571', 'https://openalex.org/W6788990321', 'https://openalex.org/W6748816842', 'https://openalex.org/W6755977528', 'https://openalex.org/W6674330103', 'https://openalex.org/W2147800946', 'https://openalex.org/W6766978945', 'https://openalex.org/W6631190155', 'https://openalex.org/W6757817989', 'https://openalex.org/W206948248', 'https://openalex.org/W3122190729', 'https://openalex.org/W2899663614', 'https://openalex.org/W4224035735', 'https://openalex.org/W1522301498', 'https://openalex.org/W3036167779', 'https://openalex.org/W4387156659', 'https://openalex.org/W4380136719', 'https://openalex.org/W4295312788', 'https://openalex.org/W2786672974', 'https://openalex.org/W4288099666', 'https://openalex.org/W4365456854', 'https://openalex.org/W2095705004', 'https://openalex.org/W4385681544', 'https://openalex.org/W2910135751', 'https://openalex.org/W4401416682', 'https://openalex.org/W2914304175', 'https://openalex.org/W2908510526', 'https://openalex.org/W3141758171', 'https://openalex.org/W4281485151', 'https://openalex.org/W4303440777']",2024-04-23
https://openalex.org/W4388761715,https://doi.org/10.17760/d20581905,Learning latent representations for controllable combinational creativity and game design,"Latent variable models have been increasingly applied for performing a variety of creative applications, primarily in the domains of visual art and music. Such models learn continuous latent representations of data which are then utilized for generating novel artifacts via sampling and interpolation, as well as for performing various other creative tasks. However, despite a growing body of work surrounding procedural content generation via machine learning (PCGML), the use of deep latent models for similar applications in games remains underexplored. While defining and using a possibility space of an individual game is a well-established practice in automated game design and procedural content generation, learning possibility spaces such that they span a set of one or more given games is uncommon, and in general, the use of generative models to enable a broader range of creative applications has not been as widely adopted for game design. Thus, in this thesis, we study how deep latent variable models can be leveraged for various game design applications, in two broad directions. First, we investigate the use of learned latent spaces for developing controllable combinational creativity systems, focusing specifically on game blending. Combinational creativity is the branch of creativity that focuses on producing novel artifacts by recombining properties of existing ones. Game blending is a combinational creativity process referring to recombining the levels and/or mechanics of two or more games to generate a new game and has been proposed as a means of capturing the process by which designers often create new games by combining ideas from existing ones. In this part, we focus on using variational autoencoders (VAEs) for building systems for performing such game blending, building up to a novel combinational creativity framework that defines and generates blends as linear combinations of learned latent design spaces. Second, we focus on using learned latent representations to enable game and level design applications more broadly. This section thus focuses on using models trained on one or more games to enable creative ML applications and affordances for game design, similar to those seen in visual art and music. We refer to these using the umbrella term Game Design via Creative ML or GDCML. More specifically, this part of the thesis demonstrates the use of supervised methods and evolutionary algorithms to enable a range of game design applications in the form of level editing, level search and optimization, level layout generation and style transfer.--Author's abstract","['https://openalex.org/W2901107321', 'https://openalex.org/W2796897898', 'https://openalex.org/W1576660662',

Due to the significant differences between images and music in terms of their modalities, there are considerable challenges in generating music from images. We introduce an image to music generation framework which can simultaneously maintain musicality and conform to the semantic content of the original image. It consists two paths, focusing on both musical element enhancement and image detail preservation. Our experiments show that the dual-path network does outperform our previous single-path model. Furthermore, our model demonstrates its ability to create music pieces of great diversity. We've set various catagorized musical terms for CLIP to match therefore enables the model to have more choices. Some generated music samples can be found in https://andyliu2008.github.io/image2music/","['https://openalex.org/W4286250570', 'https://openalex.org/W2110851725', 'https://openalex.org/W3136806279', 'https://openalex.org/W6849105126', 'https://openalex.org/W6841982715', 'https://openalex.org/W6853096648', 'https://openalex.org/W6809885388', 'https://openalex.org/W2772474126', 'https://openalex.org/W2775487773', 'https://openalex.org/W6749351710', 'https://openalex.org/W6730558285', 'https://openalex.org/W2950864153', 'https://openalex.org/W2962968152', 'https://openalex.org/W2266728343', 'https://openalex.org/W2737041163', 'https://openalex.org/W6854031379', 'https://openalex.org/W6712426025', 'https://openalex.org/W2964260444', 'https://openalex.org/W6682691769', 'https://openalex.org/W2250539671', 'https://openalex.org/W6755207826', 'https://openalex.org/W2194775991', 'https://openalex.org/W6637373629', 'https://openalex.org/W1686810756', 'https://openalex.org/W4318351475', 'https://openalex.org/W4294170691', 'https://openalex.org/W2399507222', 'https://openalex.org/W2896457183', 'https://openalex.org/W4224035735', 'https://openalex.org/W3099425575', 'https://openalex.org/W4293575120', 'https://openalex.org/W4380136719']",2023-12-15

A video camera system that captures these patterns and responds to them with rhythmic sounds or music, as these happen, could create a unique interactive experience. Creating such an experience requires a real-time translation of related visual cues into in-rhythm sounds and warrants novel real-time methods. In this work, we propose a novel learning-based system, called 'InteractiveBeat', which generates an evolving interactive soundtrack for a camera input that captures person's movements. InteractiveBeat infers body skeleton keypoints and translates them into drum rhythms using a series of sequence models. It then implements a conditional drum generation network for generating polyphonic drum sounds based on the rhythms. To guarantee real-time function, these models are integrated into a time-evolving pipeline with rules for updates. InteractiveBeat is trained and evaluated on a well-annotated large-scale dance database (AIST), and in addition, we collected a dataset of in-the-wild videos with people performing movements of various activities that correspond to background music. Furthermore, we develop a 'live' demo prototype of the system. Our evaluation results show that the system can generate interactive rhythmic drums more accurately than existing methods and achieves a non-cumulative latency of 34ms (approx. 30 fps). This allows InteractiveBeat to be synchronized with the video stream and react to real-time movements.","['https://openalex.org/W2619697695', 'https://openalex.org/W6729831399', 'https://openalex.org/W6606783348', 'https://openalex.org/W2559085405', 'https://openalex.org/W3108332675', 'https://openalex.org/W3046890131', 'https://openalex.org/W6941176339', 'https://openalex.org/W2811167645', 'https://openalex.org/W3213726885', 'https://openalex.org/W6776218486', 'https://openalex.org/W3207290297', 'https://openalex.org/W2772474126', 'https://openalex.org/W6746569791', 'https://openalex.org/W2010771919', 'https://openalex.org/W6615672858', 'https://openalex.org/W3108240585', 'https://openalex.org/W3017343282', 'https://openalex.org/W2963218389', 'https://openalex.org/W6762661407', 'https://openalex.org/W2962795401', 'https://openalex.org/W2098125043', 'https://openalex.org/W6729977899', 'https://openalex.org/W6755182157', 'https://openalex.org/W6760601182', 'https://openalex.org/W3092879656', 'https://openalex.org/W2103570990', 'https://openalex.org/W2888202177', 'https://openalex.org/W2914217321', 'https://openalex.org/W3016096605', 'https://openalex.org/W2997367363', 'https://openalex.org/W2497597915', 'https://openalex.org/W3204221554', 'https://openalex.org/W2743147997', 'https://openalex.org/W2979157532', 'https://openalex.org/W2963408210', 'https://openalex.org/W2964345931', 'https://openalex.org/W2511428026', 'https://openalex.org/W6749351710', 'https://openalex.org/W2780124704', 'https://openalex.org/W3139813613', 'https://openalex.org/W4393148499', 'https://openalex.org/W6780316881', 'https://openalex.org/W6787185846', 'https://openalex.org/W6803751523', 'https://openalex.org/W2738406145', 'https://openalex.org/W2964109005', 'https://openalex.org/W6770639321', 'https://openalex.org/W2759263543', 'https://openalex.org/W3093257790', 'https://openalex.org/W6683248184', 'https://openalex.org/W2981851635', 'https://openalex.org/W2962865004', 'https://openalex.org/W3019952993', 'https://openalex.org/W2963807156', 'https://openalex.org/W4312814772', 'https://openalex.org/W6838582276', 'https://openalex.org/W4287802874', 'https://openalex.org/W398859631', 'https://openalex.org/W3109114891', 'https://openalex.org/W2950547518', 'https://openalex.org/W569478347', 'https://openalex.org/W4380136719', 'https://openalex.org/W4319989813', 'https://openalex.org/W3102619627', 'https://openalex.org/W3111853169', 'https://openalex.org/W4212774754', 'https://openalex.org/W4293771587', 'https://openalex.org/W4318351475']",2024-01-03

In this context, we introduce a text-based music data representation method that bridges the gap for the application of large text-generation models in music creation. Addressing the characteristics of music such as smaller note dimensionality and longer length, we employed a deep generative adversarial network model based on music measures (MT-CHSE-GAN). This model integrates paragraph text generation methods, improves the quality and efficiency of music melody generation through measure-wise processing and channel attention mechanisms. The MT-CHSE-GAN model provides a novel framework for music data processing and generation, offering an effective solution to the problem of long-sequence music generation. To comprehensively evaluate the quality of the generated music, we used accuracy, loss rate, and music theory knowledge as evaluation metrics and compared our model with other music generation models. Experimental results demonstrate our method's significant advantages in music generation quality. Despite progress in the field of automatic music generation, its application still faces challenges, particularly in terms of quantitative evaluation metrics and the breadth of model applications. Future research will continue to explore expanding the model's application scope, enriching evaluation methods, and further improving the quality and expressiveness of the generated music. This study not only advances the development of music generation technology but also provides valuable experience and insights for research in related fields.","['https://openalex.org/W4380136719', 'https://openalex.org/W2592737436', 'https://openalex.org/W2088807535', 'https://openalex.org/W2601110281', 'https://openalex.org/W2561662441', 'https://openalex.org/W3104096215', 'https://openalex.org/W2772281385', 'https://openalex.org/W4378499140', 'https://openalex.org/W4384662684', 'https://openalex.org/W2963575853', 'https://openalex.org/W4385293770', 'https://openalex.org/W2148730083', 'https://openalex.org/W4391462885', 'https://openalex.org/W2151245740', 'https://openalex.org/W2293504909', 'https://openalex.org/W4320013936', 'https://openalex.org/W2031265013', 'https://openalex.org/W4390919369']",2024-01-01

If accurate, these scores provide a flexible mechanism to flag transcription errors for upstream and downstream applications. One challenging type of errors that recognisers make are deletions. These errors are not accounted for by the standard confidence estimation schemes and are hard to rectify in the upstream and downstream processing. High deletion rates are prominent in limited resource and highly mismatched training/testing conditions studied under IARPA Babel and Material programs. This paper looks at the use of bidirectional recurrent neural networks to yield confidence estimates in predicted as well as deleted words. Several simple schemes are examined for combination. To assess usefulness of this approach, the combined confidence score is examined for untranscribed data selection that favours transcriptions with lower deletion errors. Experiments are conducted using IARPA Babel/Material program languages.","['https://openalex.org/W1631260214', 'https://openalex.org/W2143577772', 'https://openalex.org/W1577202350', 'https://openalex.org/W2406451296', 'https://openalex.org/W2132030416', 'https://openalex.org/W2110073835', 'https://openalex.org/W2407922671', 'https://openalex.org/W2889080286', 'https://openalex.org/W2519224033', 'https://openalex.org/W2729190387', 'https://openalex.org/W2129334286', 'https://openalex.org/W2128135494', 'https://openalex.org/W2131774270', 'https://openalex.org/W1976526581', 'https://openalex.org/W2085628288', 'https://openalex.org/W2889162046', 'https://openalex.org/W34303869', 'https://openalex.org/W2963217176', 'https://openalex.org/W2166810516', 'https://openalex.org/W2783549597', 'https://openalex.org/W1795658042', 'https://openalex.org/W2144920829', 'https://openalex.org/W1524333225', 'https://openalex.org/W2407420912', 'https://openalex.org/W55333121', 'https://openalex.org/W2952566282', 'https://openalex.org/W2169806449', 'https://openalex.org/W2671812860', 'https://openalex.org/W2280141299', 'https://openalex.org/W2129999749', 'https://openalex.org/W2271840356', 'https://openalex.org/W2791556425', 'https://openalex.org/W2046566693', 'https://openalex.org/W2622203030']",2018-12-21

It enables standard criteria such as cross-entropy to enforce spatial constraints on activations originating from different units. Having different regions being active depending on the input unit may help network to discriminate better and as a consequence yield lower error rates. This paper investigates stimulated training for automatic speech recognition of a number of languages representing different families, alphabets, phone sets and vocabulary sizes. In particular, it looks at ensembles of stimulated networks to ensure that improved generalisation will withstand system combination effects.

Different techniques for bootstrapping acoustic models are presented. First, we present the use of acoustic-phonetic unit distances and the potential of crosslingual acoustic modeling for under-resourced languages. Experimental results on Vietnamese showed that with only a few hours of target language speech data, crosslingual context independent modeling worked better than crosslingual context dependent modeling. However, it was outperformed by the latter one, when more speech data were available. We concluded, therefore, that in both cases, crosslingual systems are better than monolingual baseline systems. The proposal of grapheme-based acoustic modeling, which avoids building a phonetic dictionary, is also investigated in our work. Finally, since the use of sub-word units (morphemes, syllables, characters, etc.) can reduce the high out-of-vocabulary rate and improve the lack of text resources in statistical language modeling for under-resourced languages, we propose several methods to decompose, normalize and combine word and sub-word lattices generated from different ASR systems. The proposed lattice combination scheme results in a relative syllable error rate reduction of 6.6% over the sentence MAP baseline method for a Vietnamese ASR task.","['https://openalex.org/W2094391517', 'https://openalex.org/W3150637114', 'https://openalex.org/W2158069733', 'https://openalex.org/W1886381962', 'https://openalex.org/W6607325517', 'https://openalex.org/W2105354660', 'https://openalex.org/W1510837697', 'https://openalex.org/W2153159136', 'https://openalex.org/W1846073453', 'https://openalex.org/W2132534451', 'https://openalex.org/W2106101143', 'https://openalex.org/W6600435476', 'https://openalex.org/W2033436836', 'https://openalex.org/W2154820175', 'https://openalex.org/W6636811518', 'https://openalex.org/W2594610113', 'https://openalex.org/W2141404479', 'https://openalex.org/W6601644286', 'https://openalex.org/W4299344082', 'https://openalex.org/W2403983345', 'https://openalex.org/W6713186479', 'https://openalex.org/W6712677759', 'https://openalex.org/W1532513216', 'https://openalex.org/W2401271578', 'https://openalex.org/W1520886244', 'https://openalex.org/W6605248007', 'https://openalex.org/W2139820289', 'https://openalex.org/W6713005659', 'https://openalex.org/W6684184871', 'https://openalex.org/W6679576089', 'https://openalex.org/W2135379785', 'https://openalex.org/W4388277788', 'https://openalex.org/W6675239441', 'https://openalex.org/W6606379130', 'https://openalex.org/W8908565', 'https://openalex.org/W6678034947', 'https://openalex.org/W6629517120', 'https://openalex.org/W813000', 'https://openalex.org/W58893626', 'https://openalex.org/W2138436078', 'https://openalex.org/W6600942878', 'https://openalex.org/W2142401923', 'https://openalex.org/W6600595526', 'https://openalex.org/W6602059946', 'https://openalex.org/W55691059', 'https://openalex.org/W156297382', 'https://openalex.org/W128364799', 'https://openalex.org/W88081813', 'https://openalex.org/W2165355580', 'https://openalex.org/W1631260214', 'https://openalex.org/W1984672765', 'https://openalex.org/W2129848961', 'https://openalex.org/W2101281673', 'https://openalex.org/W2401033099', 'https://openalex.org/W10572049', 'https://openalex.org/W144374866', 'https://openalex.org/W23024349', 'https://openalex.org/W40323203', 'https://openalex.org/W2587033535', 'https://openalex.org/W1525736366', 'https://openalex.org/W1547854313', 'https://openalex.org/W2406358862', 'https://openalex.org/W60702959', 'https://openalex.org/W67810553', 'https://openalex.org/W2399730253', 'https://openalex.org/W2401933876', 'https://openalex.org/W14331692', 'https://openalex.org/W2276283915', 'https://openalex.org/W2918013879', 'https://openalex.org/W2573273887', 'https://openalex.org/W50642703', 'https://openalex.org/W1494693235', 'https://openalex.org/W180168658', 'https://openalex.org/W2398235957']",2009-04-28

However, the model is not guaranteed to properly handle switches in language within an utterance, thus lacking the flexibility to recognize mixed-language speech such as code-switching. In this paper, we extend our model to enable dynamic tracking of the language within an utterance, and propose a training procedure that takes advantage of a newly created mixed-language speech corpus.

In contrast, sequence-to-sequence models are well suited for multilingual ASR because they encapsulate an acoustic, pronunciation and language model jointly in a single network. In this work we present a single sequence-to-sequence ASR model trained on 9 different Indian languages, which have very little overlap in their scripts. Specifically, we take a union of language-specific grapheme sets and train a grapheme-based sequence-to-sequence model jointly on data from all languages. We find that this model, which is not explicitly given any information about language identity, improves recognition performance by 21% relative compared to analogous sequence-to-sequence models trained on each language individually. By modifying the model to accept a language identifier as an additional input feature, we further improve performance by an additional 7% relative and eliminate confusion between different languages.","['https://openalex.org/W6649207683', 'https://openalex.org/W2025198378', 'https://openalex.org/W6675791022', 'https://openalex.org/W2633221078', 'https://openalex.org/W6656670161', 'https://openalex.org/W1975550806', 'https://openalex.org/W2327501763', 'https://openalex.org/W6743440867', 'https://openalex.org/W1489125746', 'https://openalex.org/W2033436836', 'https://openalex.org/W2577366047', 'https://openalex.org/W73572011', 'https://openalex.org/W6679469922', 'https://openalex.org/W1968147312', 'https://openalex.org/W6679081875', 'https://openalex.org/W6678250534', 'https://openalex.org/W1605308203', 'https://openalex.org/W6644703941', 'https://openalex.org/W2091746061', 'https://openalex.org/W2064675550', 'https://openalex.org/W2913340405', 'https://openalex.org/W2131774270', 'https://openalex.org/W6676315081', 'https://openalex.org/W2138992227', 'https://openalex.org/W2168231600', 'https://openalex.org/W2750499125', 'https://openalex.org/W2127982613', 'https://openalex.org/W2130414229', 'https://openalex.org/W1978660892', 'https://openalex.org/W1994606281', 'https://openalex.org/W2025401819', 'https://openalex.org/W2123798005', 'https://openalex.org/W2106440210', 'https://openalex.org/W2108677974']",2018-04-01

The approach benefits by performing model training without using lexicon and alignments. However, this poses a new problem of requiring more data compared to conventional DNN-HMM systems. In this work, we attempt to use data from 10 BABEL languages to build a multilingual seq2seq model as a prior model, and then port them towards 4 other BABEL languages using transfer learning approach. We also explore different architectures for improving the prior multilingual seq2seq model. The paper also discusses the effect of integrating a recurrent neural network language model (RNNLM) with a seq2seq model during decoding. Experimental results show that the transfer learning approach from the multilingual model shows substantial gains over monolingual models across all 4 BABEL languages. Incorporating an RNNLM also brings significant improvements in terms of %WER, and achieves recognition performance comparable to the models trained with twice more training data.","['https://openalex.org/W2038810952', 'https://openalex.org/W6739324457', 'https://openalex.org/W2096140469', 'https://openalex.org/W2586412610', 'https://openalex.org/W6746041127', 'https://openalex.org/W2094147890', 'https://openalex.org/W2743818757', 'https://openalex.org/W2963292011', 'https://openalex.org/W2786835190', 'https://openalex.org/W2964309797', 'https://openalex.org/W2766219058', 'https://openalex.org/W2964089206', 'https://openalex.org/W6720877245', 'https://openalex.org/W6623517193', 'https://openalex.org/W2064675550', 'https://openalex.org/W2157331557', 'https://openalex.org/W950853366', 'https://openalex.org/W2962780374', 'https://openalex.org/W6675365184', 'https://openalex.org/W2697044473', 'https://openalex.org/W2327501763', 'https://openalex.org/W6679434410', 'https://openalex.org/W2091746061', 'https://openalex.org/W6679436768', 'https://openalex.org/W6747158283', 'https://openalex.org/W6739366949', 'https://openalex.org/W2131774270', 'https://openalex.org/W6631362777', 'https://openalex.org/W854541894', 'https://openalex.org/W2964308564', 'https://openalex.org/W2964272710', 'https://openalex.org/W1686810756', 'https://openalex.org/W2130942839', 'https://openalex.org/W2474824677', 'https://openalex.org/W2133564696', 'https://openalex.org/W2102113734', 'https://openalex.org/W2633221078', 'https://openalex.org/W2769437540', 'https://openalex.org/W2627092829', 'https://openalex.org/W4294619417', 'https://openalex.org/W2963403664', 'https://openalex.org/W1524333225']",2018-12-01

We train a Transformer-based masked language model on one hundred languages, using more than two terabytes of filtered CommonCrawl data. Our model, dubbed XLM-R, significantly outperforms multilingual BERT (mBERT) on a variety of cross-lingual benchmarks, including +14.6% average accuracy on XNLI, +13% average F1 score on MLQA, and +2.4% F1 score on NER. XLM-R performs particularly well on low-resource languages, improving 15.7% in XNLI accuracy for Swahili and 11.4% for Urdu over previous XLM models. We also present a detailed empirical analysis of the key factors that are required to achieve these gains, including the trade-offs between (1) positive transfer and capacity dilution and (2) the performance of high and low resource languages at scale. Finally, we show, for the first time, the possibility of multilingual modeling without sacrificing per-language performance; XLM-R is very competitive with strong monolingual models on the GLUE and XNLI benchmarks.

We also investigate various seed models for transfer learning. Experimental evaluations using the IARPA BABEL data set show that LM fusion transfer improves performances on all target five languages compared with simple transfer learning when the external text data is available.

Sharing parameters across classes (or constraining the parameters) clearly tends to alleviate the first three problems. We show that in some cases it can also lead to better discrimination (as evidenced by reduced misclassification error). The parameters considered are the means and variances of the Gaussians and linear transformations of the feature space (or equivalently the Gaussian means). Some constraints on the parameters are shown to lead to linear discrimination analysis (a well-known result) while others are shown to lead to optimal feature spaces (a relatively new result).

Unfortunately when using full or block-diagonal covariance matrices there tends to be a dramatic increase in the number of parameters per Gaussian component, limiting the number of components which may be robustly estimated. This paper introduces a new form of covariance matrix which allows a few ""full"" covariance matrices to be shared over many distributions, whilst each distribution maintains its own ""diagonal"" covariance matrix. In contrast to other schemes which have hypothesized a similar form, this technique fits within the standard maximum-likelihood criterion used for training HMMs. The new form of covariance matrix is evaluated on a large-vocabulary speech-recognition task. In initial experiments the performance of the standard system was achieved using approximately half the number of parameters. Moreover, a 10% reduction in word error rate compared to a standard system can be achieved with less than a 1% increase in the number of parameters and little increase in recognition time.","['https://openalex.org/W2037740282', 'https://openalex.org/W2014089984', 'https://openalex.org/W2146871184', 'https://openalex.org/W1980800561', 'https://openalex.org/W2070545637', 'https://openalex.org/W2081323593', 'https://openalex.org/W2125838338', 'https://openalex.org/W7048738093', 'https://openalex.org/W2148154194', 'https://openalex.org/W6633351333', 'https://openalex.org/W2019368538', 'https://openalex.org/W142684478', 'https://openalex.org/W2158069733', 'https://openalex.org/W2002342963', 'https://openalex.org/W2049633694', 'https://openalex.org/W2135346934', 'https://openalex.org/W4298379700', 'https://openalex.org/W31925794', 'https://openalex.org/W3129711340', 'https://openalex.org/W2411442511', 'https://openalex.org/W2772658608', 'https://openalex.org/W1557500035']",1999-05-01

It is motivated by the fact that variability in SI acoustic models is attributed to both phonetic variation and variation among the speakers of the training population, that is independent of the information content of the speech signal. These two variation sources are decoupled and the proposed method jointly annihilates the inter-speaker variation and estimates the HMM parameters of the SI acoustic models. We compare the proposed training algorithm to the common SI training paradigm within the context of supervised adaptation. We show that the proposed acoustic models are more efficiently adapted to the test speakers, thus achieving significant overall word error rate reductions of 19% and 25% for 20K and 5K vocabulary tasks respectively.","['https://openalex.org/W2124052683', 'https://openalex.org/W2121681768', 'https://openalex.org/W2086699924', 'https://openalex.org/W2398991154', 'https://openalex.org/W2167152389', 'https://openalex.org/W2099914327', 'https://openalex.org/W2140567543', 'https://openalex.org/W7048738093', 'https://openalex.org/W2149007717', 'https://openalex.org/W4285719527', 'https://openalex.org/W2049633694', 'https://openalex.org/W1601032495']",2002-12-24

For that, we combine an iterative Dirichlet process Gaussian mixture model (DPGMM) clustering framework with a standard pipeline for supervised GMM-HMM acoustic model (AM) and n-gram language model (LM) training, enhanced by a scheme for iterative model re-training. We use the DPGMM to cluster feature vectors into a dynamically sized set of acoustic units. The frame based class labels serve as transcriptions of the audio data and are used as input to the AM and LM training pipeline. We show that iterative unsupervised model re-training of this DPGMM-HMM acoustic unit recognizer improves performance according to an ABX sound class discriminability task based evaluation. Our results show that the learned models generalize well and that sound class discriminability benefits from contextual information introduced by the language model. Our systems are competitive with supervisedly trained phone recognizers, and can beat the baseline set by DPGMM clustering.","['https://openalex.org/W2118841860', 'https://openalex.org/W2114347655', 'https://openalex.org/W2117041980', 'https://openalex.org/W2126203737', 'https://openalex.org/W6677734967', 'https://openalex.org/W6602705600', 'https://openalex.org/W6712553779', 'https://openalex.org/W6704305767', 'https://openalex.org/W2509930204', 'https://openalex.org/W2963684067', 'https://openalex.org/W2137826140', 'https://openalex.org/W2402014506', 'https://openalex.org/W2056786202', 'https://openalex.org/W1975113979', 'https://openalex.org/W2401464865', 'https://openalex.org/W2078769636', 'https://openalex.org/W2064210461', 'https://openalex.org/W6675022971', 'https://openalex.org/W6973666849', 'https://openalex.org/W6712444837', 'https://openalex.org/W4234482113', 'https://openalex.org/W6678947187', 'https://openalex.org/W6636811518', 'https://openalex.org/W6631362777', 'https://openalex.org/W2146950091', 'https://openalex.org/W2113641473', 'https://openalex.org/W2128032727', 'https://openalex.org/W2345811097', 'https://openalex.org/W2395899413', 'https://openalex.org/W2399576818', 'https://openalex.org/W2963620343', 'https://openalex.org/W66167291', 'https://openalex.org/W1631260214', 'https://openalex.org/W2786608204', 'https://openalex.org/W1524333225', 'https://openalex.org/W2119187236', 'https://openalex.org/W3148201686', 'https://openalex.org/W2100768664']",2016-12-01

This problem relates to the estimation of the likelihood of a novel event occurring. Although several methods have been used, their suitability has been on empirical evaluation rather than a well-founded model. The authors propose the application of a Poisson process model of novelty. Its ability to predict novel tokens is evaluated, and it consistently outperforms existing methods. It is applied to a practical statistical coding scheme, where a slight modification is required to avoid divergence. The result is a well-founded zero-frequency model that explains observed differences in the performance of existing methods, and offers a small improvement in the coding efficiency of text compression over the best method previously known.< <ETX xmlns:mml=""http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"" xmlns:xlink=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"">&gt;</ETX>","['https://openalex.org/W2095306947', 'https://openalex.org/W4247267886', 'https://openalex.org/W1975965284', 'https://openalex.org/W2161628678', 'https://openalex.org/W2152851525', 'https://openalex.org/W2046419776', 'https://openalex.org/W2911940095', 'https://openalex.org/W1974717499', 'https://openalex.org/W2107745473', 'https://openalex.org/W2129652681', 'https://openalex.org/W2119047110', 'https://openalex.org/W2122962290', 'https://openalex.org/W2146368895', 'https://openalex.org/W2171763016', 'https://openalex.org/W2007108779', 'https://openalex.org/W4285719527', 'https://openalex.org/W2126163471', 'https://openalex.org/W2045740840', 'https://openalex.org/W45615632', 'https://openalex.org/W2611071497', 'https://openalex.org/W17078302', 'https://openalex.org/W1519253855']",1991-07-01

The idea is to automatically find a mapping of feature vectors into a subspace that is more suitable for Dirichlet process Gaussian mixture model (DPGMM) based clustering, without the need of supervision. Supervised acoustic modeling typically makes use of feature transformations such as LDA to minimize intra-class discriminability, to maximize inter-class discriminability and to extract relevant informations from high-dimensional features spanning larger contexts. The need of class labels makes it difficult to use this technique in a zero resource setting where the classes and even their amount are unknown. To overcome this issue we use a first iteration of DPGMM clustering on standard features to generate labels for the data, that serve as basis for learning a proper transformation. A second clustering operates on the transformed features. The application of unsupervised LDA demonstrably leads to better clustering results given the unsupervised data. We show that the improved input features consistently outperform our baseline input features.","['https://openalex.org/W2118841860', 'https://openalex.org/W2114347655', 'https://openalex.org/W2117041980', 'https://openalex.org/W2126203737', 'https://openalex.org/W1502957213', 'https://openalex.org/W1997505733', 'https://openalex.org/W2399576818', 'https://openalex.org/W2001619934', 'https://openalex.org/W2064210461', 'https://openalex.org/W2402014506', 'https://openalex.org/W1981276685', 'https://openalex.org/W2346964103', 'https://openalex.org/W2395899413', 'https://openalex.org/W2294798173', 'https://openalex.org/W2071128523', 'https://openalex.org/W66167291', 'https://openalex.org/W2119187236', 'https://openalex.org/W2786608204', 'https://openalex.org/W2128032727']",2016-01-01

Audio Word2Vec previously proposed was shown to be able to represent audio segments for spoken words as such vectors carrying information about the phonetic structures of the signal segments. However, each linguistic unit (word, syllable, phoneme in text form) corresponds to unlimited number of audio segments with vector representations inevitably spread over the embedding space, which causes some confusion. It is therefore desired to better cluster the audio embeddings such that those corresponding to the same linguistic unit can be more compactly distributed. In this paper, inspired by Siamese networks, we propose some approaches to achieve the above goal. This includes identifying positive and negative pairs from unlabeled data for Siamese style training, disentangling acoustic factors such as speaker characteristics from the audio embedding, handling unbalanced data distribution, and having the embedding processes learn from the adjacency relationships among data points. All these can be done in an unsupervised way. Improved performance was obtained in preliminary experiments on the LibriSpeech data set, including clustering characteristics analysis and applications of spoken term detection.","['https://openalex.org/W2190506272', 'https://openalex.org/W2807071886', 'https://openalex.org/W1494198834', 'https://openalex.org/W2295088914', 'https://openalex.org/W2951216052', 'https://openalex.org/W2951828005', 'https://openalex.org/W2884305338', 'https://openalex.org/W2949844463', 'https://openalex.org/W2030422732', 'https://openalex.org/W2550241133', 'https://openalex.org/W2950635152', 'https://openalex.org/W2751947065', 'https://openalex.org/W2401725913', 'https://openalex.org/W2025482506', 'https://openalex.org/W2794739275', 'https://openalex.org/W2888845873', 'https://openalex.org/W1577418252', 'https://openalex.org/W2963571336', 'https://openalex.org/W1610356397']",2018-11-07

We observe that the state-of-the-art achievements were obtained by carefully balancing the reconstruction loss and adversarial loss, and such balance shifts with different network structures, datasets, and training strategies. Empirical studies have demonstrated that an inappropriate weight between the two losses may cause instability, and it is tricky to search for the optimal setting, especially when lacking prior knowledge on the data and network. This paper gives the first attempt to relax the need of manual balancing by proposing the concept of decoupled learning, where a novel network structure is designed that explicitly disentangles the backpropagation paths of the two losses. In existing works, the encoding-decoding nets and GANs are integrated by sharing weights on the generator/decoder, thus the two losses are backpropagated to the generator/decoder simultaneously, where a weighting factor is needed to balance the interaction between the two losses. The decoupled learning avoids the interaction and thus removes the requirement of the weighting factor, essentially improving the generalization capacity of the designed model to different applications. The decoupled learning framework could be easily adapted to most existing encoding-decoding-based generative networks and achieve competitive performance without the need of weight adjustment. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness, robustness, and generality of the proposed method. The other contribution of the paper is the design of a new evaluation metric to measure the image quality of generative models. We propose the so-called normalized relative discriminative score (NRDS), which introduces the idea of relative comparison, rather than providing absolute estimates like existing metrics.","['https://openalex.org/W6717255582', 'https://openalex.org/W2533598788', 'https://openalex.org/W2963420272', 'https://openalex.org/W6713645886', 'https://openalex.org/W2963073614', 'https://openalex.org/W2053757129', 'https://openalex.org/W6718379498', 'https://openalex.org/W6734382031', 'https://openalex.org/W2962793481', 'https://openalex.org/W6726794401', 'https://openalex.org/W2962947361', 'https://openalex.org/W2405756170', 'https://openalex.org/W2592232824', 'https://openalex.org/W4293568373', 'https://openalex.org/W2952288113', 'https://openalex.org/W4297752781', 'https://openalex.org/W2554314924', 'https://openalex.org/W2620770761', 'https://openalex.org/W2099471712', 'https://openalex.org/W2963470893', 'https://openalex.org/W2593414223', 'https://openalex.org/W189587150', 'https://openalex.org/W1959608418', 'https://openalex.org/W2963464195', 'https://openalex.org/W2577946330', 'https://openalex.org/W2519536754', 'https://openalex.org/W4311415873', 'https://openalex.org/W4293320219', 'https://openalex.org/W2964167449', 'https://openalex.org/W2548275288', 'https://openalex.org/W2950776302', 'https://openalex.org/W2173520492', 'https://openalex.org/W2963373786', 'https://openalex.org/W4320013936', 'https://openalex.org/W1797268635', 'https://openalex.org/W2202109488']",2018-03-01

This has renewed interest in whether these generic sequence processing devices are inducing genuine linguistic knowledge. Nearly all current analytical studies, however, initialize the RNNs with a vocabulary of known words, and feed them tokenized input during training. We present a multi-lingual study of the linguistic knowledge encoded in RNNs trained as character-level language models, on input data with word boundaries removed. These networks face a tougher and more cognitively realistic task, having to discover any useful linguistic unit from scratch based on input statistics. The results show that our “near tabula rasa” RNNs are mostly able to solve morphological, syntactic and semantic tasks that intuitively presuppose word-level knowledge, and indeed they learned, to some extent, to track word boundaries. Our study opens the door to speculations about the necessity of an explicit, rigid word lexicon in language learning and usage.","['https://openalex.org/W2085663684', 'https://openalex.org/W2905532018', 'https://openalex.org/W2029948425', 'https://openalex.org/W2018982897', 'https://openalex.org/W2166391802', 'https://openalex.org/W4241976975', 'https://openalex.org/W354650940', 'https://openalex.org/W2110485445', 'https://openalex.org/W1988126949', 'https://openalex.org/W2255581062', 'https://openalex.org/W2883158411', 'https://openalex.org/W2480148714', 'https://openalex.org/W4210984920', 'https://openalex.org/W2126377586', 'https://openalex.org/W2064675550', 'https://openalex.org/W2963430224', 'https://openalex.org/W1971624066', 'https://openalex.org/W3140196993', 'https://openalex.org/W2292919134', 'https://openalex.org/W2295297373', 'https://openalex.org/W2020944885', 'https://openalex.org/W2531882892', 'https://openalex.org/W2531207078', 'https://openalex.org/W2549835527', 'https://openalex.org/W2104752510', 'https://openalex.org/W2507974895', 'https://openalex.org/W4252588748', 'https://openalex.org/W2148917251', 'https://openalex.org/W1522263329', 'https://openalex.org/W2510248383', 'https://openalex.org/W2781528640', 'https://openalex.org/W3105148948', 'https://openalex.org/W591353820', 'https://openalex.org/W2953318277', 'https://openalex.org/W2767360697', 'https://openalex.org/W2759181158', 'https://openalex.org/W2888958984', 'https://openalex.org/W2884554299', 'https://openalex.org/W2168488947', 'https://openalex.org/W196214544', 'https://openalex.org/W2963751529', 'https://openalex.org/W1938755728', 'https://openalex.org/W2949888546', 'https://openalex.org/W2900065283', 'https://openalex.org/W1614298861', 'https://openalex.org/W1527142120', 'https://openalex.org/W2561296568', 'https://openalex.org/W1722351164', 'https://openalex.org/W2905623858', 'https://openalex.org/W2788924045', 'https://openalex.org/W1810943226', 'https://openalex.org/W1579929927', 'https://openalex.org/W2559655401', 'https://openalex.org/W1550933260', 'https://openalex.org/W608050949', 'https://openalex.org/W2964072233', 'https://openalex.org/W2515741950', 'https://openalex.org/W2606347107', 'https://openalex.org/W2038542953', 'https://openalex.org/W2346280181', 'https://openalex.org/W2792376130', 'https://openalex.org/W2963025830', 'https://openalex.org/W2803214681', 'https://openalex.org/W2964289395', 'https://openalex.org/W2108425242', 'https://openalex.org/W2141599568', 'https://openalex.org/W2605717780', 'https://openalex.org/W2964159778', 'https://openalex.org/W2563574619', 'https://openalex.org/W2124059530', 'https://openalex.org/W2963208801', 'https://openalex.org/W2889506631', 'https://openalex.org/W331019419', 'https://openalex.org/W2167723982', 'https://openalex.org/W2911267749', 'https://openalex.org/W4387627350', 'https://openalex.org/W2579599705', 'https://openalex.org/W2799124508', 'https://openalex.org/W2176796957', 'https://openalex.org/W653912306', 'https://openalex.org/W4299895104']",2019-09-11

Linguistic regularities are often sensitive to syntactic structure; can such dependencies be captured by LSTMs, which do not have explicit structural representations? We begin addressing this question using number agreement in English subject-verb dependencies. We probe the architecture’s grammatical competence both using training objectives with an explicit grammatical target (number prediction, grammaticality judgments) and using language models. In the strongly supervised settings, the LSTM achieved very high overall accuracy (less than 1% errors), but errors increased when sequential and structural information conflicted. The frequency of such errors rose sharply in the language-modeling setting. We conclude that LSTMs can capture a non-trivial amount of grammatical structure given targeted supervision, but stronger architectures may be required to further reduce errors; furthermore, the language modeling signal is insufficient for capturing syntax-sensitive dependencies, and should be supplemented with more direct supervision if such dependencies need to be captured.","['https://openalex.org/W4245765565', 'https://openalex.org/W2087807962', 'https://openalex.org/W2147571305', 'https://openalex.org/W2110485445', 'https://openalex.org/W2151834591', 'https://openalex.org/W2190736972', 'https://openalex.org/W1988126949', 'https://openalex.org/W2121029939', 'https://openalex.org/W2064675550', 'https://openalex.org/W2301095666', 'https://openalex.org/W1970526427', 'https://openalex.org/W1972085588', 'https://openalex.org/W2116723809', 'https://openalex.org/W1965511524', 'https://openalex.org/W2100808592', 'https://openalex.org/W2082041499', 'https://openalex.org/W1951216520', 'https://openalex.org/W595069947', 'https://openalex.org/W4231809946', 'https://openalex.org/W2914746235', 'https://openalex.org/W2259472270', 'https://openalex.org/W2963069010', 'https://openalex.org/W2251529809', 'https://openalex.org/W2963447120', 'https://openalex.org/W2013833248', 'https://openalex.org/W2292919134', 'https://openalex.org/W2157331557', 'https://openalex.org/W1602017060', 'https://openalex.org/W2024988999', 'https://openalex.org/W2600110521', 'https://openalex.org/W2160073299', 'https://openalex.org/W4285719527', 'https://openalex.org/W2964121744', 'https://openalex.org/W2964159778', 'https://openalex.org/W2402268235', 'https://openalex.org/W2157889740', 'https://openalex.org/W2170716495', 'https://openalex.org/W1595256356', 'https://openalex.org/W2134991647', 'https://openalex.org/W2105214622', 'https://openalex.org/W2087946919', 'https://openalex.org/W2118170533', 'https://openalex.org/W1732222442', 'https://openalex.org/W2951714314', 'https://openalex.org/W2963073938', 'https://openalex.org/W2964308564', 'https://openalex.org/W1574036494', 'https://openalex.org/W179875071', 'https://openalex.org/W2974832207']",2016-12-01

The Case of Basque,"Sequential neural networks models are powerful tools in a variety of Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks. The sequential nature of these models raises the questions: to what extent can these models implicitly learn hierarchical structures typical to human language, and what kind of grammatical phenomena can they acquire? We focus on the task of agreement prediction in Basque, as a case study for a task that requires implicit understanding of sentence structure and the acquisition of a complex but consistent morphological system. Analyzing experimental results from two syntactic prediction tasks – verb number prediction and suffix recovery – we find that sequential models perform worse on agreement prediction in Basque than one might expect on the basis of a previous agreement prediction work in English. Tentative findings based on diagnostic classifiers suggest the network makes use of local heuristics as a proxy for the hierarchical structure of the sentence. We propose the Basque agreement prediction task as challenging benchmark for models that attempt to learn regularities in human language.","['https://openalex.org/W2768794963', 'https://openalex.org/W2549835527', 'https://openalex.org/W2963571341', 'https://openalex.org/W2963430224', 'https://openalex.org/W2962776659', 'https://openalex.org/W2964121744', 'https://openalex.org/W2552110825', 'https://openalex.org/W782259221', 'https://openalex.org/W2949952998', 'https://openalex.org/W1810943226', 'https://openalex.org/W4210984920', 'https://openalex.org/W2064675550', 'https://openalex.org/W2126807068', 'https://openalex.org/W1522301498', 'https://openalex.org/W2563574619', 'https://openalex.org/W2826721128', 'https://openalex.org/W2963751529', 'https://openalex.org/W2259472270', 'https://openalex.org/W2134036914', 'https://openalex.org/W2963748792', 'https://openalex.org/W583659850', 'https://openalex.org/W2157331557', 'https://openalex.org/W1924770834', 'https://openalex.org/W2515741950', 'https://openalex.org/W2963951265', 'https://openalex.org/W1951216520', 'https://openalex.org/W4300427683', 'https://openalex.org/W2786167576', 'https://openalex.org/W2606089314', 'https://openalex.org/W2301095666', 'https://openalex.org/W1601694074']",2018-01-01

In our experiments we have used Multilingual Artificial Neural Network (ANN), where each language is modelled by separate output layer, while all the hidden layers jointly model the variability of all the source languages. The key idea is that the entire ANN is trained on all the languages simultaneously, thus the BN-features are not biased towards any of the languages. Exactly for this reason, the final BN-features are considered as language independent. In the experiments with GlobalPhone database, we show that Multilingual BN-features consistently outperform Monolingual BN-features. Also, cross-lingual generalization is evaluated, where we train on 5 source languages and test on 3 other languages. The results show that the ANN can produce very good BN-features even for unseen languages, in some cases even better than if we trained the ANN on the target language only.","['https://openalex.org/W6713204639', 'https://openalex.org/W2143355529', 'https://openalex.org/W6604916345', 'https://openalex.org/W2072349636', 'https://openalex.org/W6615085950', 'https://openalex.org/W1991180839', 'https://openalex.org/W6602682705', 'https://openalex.org/W6738263903', 'https://openalex.org/W6679081875', 'https://openalex.org/W2090764203', 'https://openalex.org/W2012897754', 'https://openalex.org/W2165712214', 'https://openalex.org/W1501286448', 'https://openalex.org/W6635896687', 'https://openalex.org/W2105354660', 'https://openalex.org/W1507177964', 'https://openalex.org/W1604771987', 'https://openalex.org/W2127982613', 'https://openalex.org/W121155700', 'https://openalex.org/W2402698866', 'https://openalex.org/W2618180021', 'https://openalex.org/W66627554']",2012-12-01

Generally, approaches have relied on control variates to reduce the variance of the REINFORCE estimator. Recent work (Jang et al. 2016, Maddison et al. 2016) has taken a different approach, introducing a continuous relaxation of discrete variables to produce low-variance, but biased, gradient estimates. In this work, we combine the two approaches through a novel control variate that produces low-variance, \emph{unbiased} gradient estimates. Then, we introduce a modification to the continuous relaxation and show that the tightness of the relaxation can be adapted online, removing it as a hyperparameter. We show state-of-the-art variance reduction on several benchmark generative modeling tasks, generally leading to faster convergence to a better final log-likelihood.",[],2017-03-21
https://openalex.org/W1583776211,https://doi.org/10.48550/arxiv.1305.2982,Estimating or Propagating Gradients Through Stochastic Neurons,"Stochastic neurons can be useful for a number of reasons in deep learning models, but in many cases they pose a challenging problem: how to estimate the gradient of a loss function with respect to the input of such stochastic neurons, i.e., can we ""back-propagate"" through these stochastic neurons? We examine this question, existing approaches, and present two novel families of solutions, applicable in different settings. In particular, it is demonstrated that a simple biologically plausible formula gives rise to an an unbiased (but noisy) estimator of the gradient with respect to a binary stochastic neuron firing probability. Unlike other estimators which view the noise as a small perturbation in order to estimate gradients by finite differences, this estimator is unbiased even without assuming that the stochastic perturbation is small. This estimator is also interesting because it can be applied in very general settings which do not allow gradient back-propagation, including the estimation of the gradient with respect to future rewards, as required in reinforcement learning setups. We also propose an approach to approximating this unbiased but high-variance estimator by learning to predict it using a biased estimator. The second approach we propose assumes that an estimator of the gradient can be back-propagated and it provides an unbiased estimator of the gradient, but can only work with non-linearities unlike the hard threshold, but like the rectifier, that are not flat for all of their range. This is similar to traditional sigmoidal units but has the advantage that for many inputs, a hard decision (e.g., a 0 output) can be produced, which would be convenient for conditional computation and achieving sparse representations and sparse gradients.","['https://openalex.org/W1613249581', 'https://openalex.org/W2124289529', 'https://openalex.org/W2025768430', 'https://openalex.org/W2072128103', 'https://openalex.org/W2294059674', 'https://openalex.org/W2156387975', 'https://openalex.org/W2136922672', 'https://openalex.org/W2099257174', 'https://openalex.org/W60493759', 'https://openalex.org/W2041176801', 'https://openalex.org/W1665214252', 'https://openalex.org/W1498436455', 'https://openalex.org/W2913932916', 'https://openalex.org/W1904365287', 'https://openalex.org/W2163605009']",2013-05-14

Because it replaces entire pipelines of hand-engineered components with neural networks, end-to-end learning allows us to handle a diverse variety of speech including noisy environments, accents and different languages. Key to our approach is our application of HPC techniques, resulting in a 7x speedup over our previous system. Because of this efficiency, experiments that previously took weeks now run in days. This enables us to iterate more quickly to identify superior architectures and algorithms. As a result, in several cases, our system is competitive with the transcription of human workers when benchmarked on standard datasets. Finally, using a technique called Batch Dispatch with GPUs in the data center, we show that our system can be inexpensively deployed in an online setting, delivering low latency when serving users at scale.","['https://openalex.org/W1993882792', 'https://openalex.org/W1553004968', 'https://openalex.org/W2064675550', 'https://openalex.org/W2112739286', 'https://openalex.org/W2117671523', 'https://openalex.org/W1835666251', 'https://openalex.org/W2102113734', 'https://openalex.org/W2288645994', 'https://openalex.org/W1922655562', 'https://openalex.org/W2163680580', 'https://openalex.org/W1517386993', 'https://openalex.org/W2109726413', 'https://openalex.org/W2253807446', 'https://openalex.org/W2296748324', 'https://openalex.org/W2949190276', 'https://openalex.org/W2134557905', 'https://openalex.org/W1586532344', 'https://openalex.org/W1494198834', 'https://openalex.org/W2951781666', 'https://openalex.org/W2963920996', 'https://openalex.org/W2162390675', 'https://openalex.org/W2950179405', 'https://openalex.org/W2168231600', 'https://openalex.org/W2289394825', 'https://openalex.org/W104184427', 'https://openalex.org/W2962949994', 'https://openalex.org/W2293634267', 'https://openalex.org/W1836465849', 'https://openalex.org/W1855892484', 'https://openalex.org/W2127141656', 'https://openalex.org/W2157331557', 'https://openalex.org/W2066824132', 'https://openalex.org/W2394932179', 'https://openalex.org/W2147768505', 'https://openalex.org/W2293858598', 'https://openalex.org/W2963211739', 'https://openalex.org/W2109886035', 'https://openalex.org/W2184045248', 'https://openalex.org/W1710082047', 'https://openalex.org/W1667652561', 'https://openalex.org/W2076014259', 'https://openalex.org/W1600744878', 'https://openalex.org/W2138243089', 'https://openalex.org/W2155273149', 'https://openalex.org/W2169272853', 'https://openalex.org/W1581407678', 'https://openalex.org/W2120432001', 'https://openalex.org/W2296073425', 'https://openalex.org/W2169189000', 'https://openalex.org/W2143612262', 'https://openalex.org/W2618530766']",2015-12-08

There has been a surge in interest in discrete latent variable models, however, despite several recent improvements, the training of discrete latent variable models has remained challenging and their performance has mostly failed to match their continuous counterparts. Recent work on vector quantized autoencoders (VQ-VAE) has made substantial progress in this direction, with its perplexity almost matching that of a VAE on datasets such as CIFAR-10. In this work, we investigate an alternate training technique for VQ-VAE, inspired by its connection to the Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm. Training the discrete bottleneck with EM helps us achieve better image generation results on CIFAR-10, and together with knowledge distillation, allows us to develop a non-autoregressive machine translation model whose accuracy almost matches a strong greedy autoregressive baseline Transformer, while being 3.3 times faster at inference.","['https://openalex.org/W2952264928', 'https://openalex.org/W1821462560', 'https://openalex.org/W1522301498', 'https://openalex.org/W2949382160', 'https://openalex.org/W2963434219', 'https://openalex.org/W2119717200', 'https://openalex.org/W2547875792', 'https://openalex.org/W2949888546', 'https://openalex.org/W2789543585', 'https://openalex.org/W2594961016', 'https://openalex.org/W2964308564', 'https://openalex.org/W2008225289', 'https://openalex.org/W2963629403', 'https://openalex.org/W2049633694', 'https://openalex.org/W2142838865', 'https://openalex.org/W2423557781', 'https://openalex.org/W2785779000', 'https://openalex.org/W2072634211', 'https://openalex.org/W2964122153', 'https://openalex.org/W2767002724', 'https://openalex.org/W2119072456', 'https://openalex.org/W2950237263', 'https://openalex.org/W2463507112', 'https://openalex.org/W2148554573', 'https://openalex.org/W2626778328', 'https://openalex.org/W2950300355', 'https://openalex.org/W2127218421']",2018-05-28
https://openalex.org/W2979454998,,The information bottleneck method,"We define the relevant information in a signal x ∈ X as being the information that this signal provides about another signal y ∈ Y. Examples include the information that face images provide about the names of the people portrayed, or the information that speech sounds provide about the words spoken. Understanding the signal x requires more than just predicting y, it also requires specifying which features of X play a role in the prediction. We formalize this problem as that of finding a short code for X that preserves the maximum information about Y. That is, we squeeze the information that X provides about Y through a ‘bottleneck ’ formed by a limited set of codewords ˜X. This constrained optimization problem can be seen as a generalization of rate distortion theory in which the distortion measure d(x, ˜x) emerges from the joint statistics of X and Y. This approach yields an exact set of self consistent equations for the coding rules X → ˜ X and ˜ X → Y. Solutions to these equations can be found by a convergent re–estimation method that generalizes the Blahut–Arimoto algorithm. Our variational principle provides a surprisingly rich framework for discussing a variety of problems in signal processing and learning, as will be described in detail elsewhere. 1 1","['https://openalex.org/W2103723258', 'https://openalex.org/W2148986322', 'https://openalex.org/W2127314673', 'https://openalex.org/W2099111195', 'https://openalex.org/W3193262203']",2000-04-24

In this paper, we explore LSTM RNN architectures for large scale acoustic modeling in speech recognition. We recently showed that LSTM RNNs are more effective than DNNs and conventional RNNs for acoustic modeling, considering moderately-sized models trained on a single machine. Here, we introduce the first distributed training of LSTM RNNs using asynchronous stochastic gradient descent optimization on a large cluster of machines. We show that a two-layer deep LSTM RNN where each LSTM layer has a linear recurrent projection layer can exceed state-of-the-art speech recognition performance. This architecture makes more effective use of model parameters than the others considered, converges quickly, and outperforms a deep feed forward neural network having an order of magnitude more parameters.

The motivation of using such transformations is to create feature vectors that are more suitable for clustering. The need of labels for these methods makes it difficult to use them in a zero resource setting. To overcome this issue we utilize a first iteration of DPGMM clustering to generate frame based class labels for the target data. The labels serve as basis for learning linear discriminant analysis (LDA), maximum likelihood linear transform (MLLT) and feature-space maximum likelihood linear regression (fMLLR) based feature transformations. The novelty of our approach is the way how we use a traditional acoustic model training pipeline for supervised learning to estimate feature transformations in a zero resource scenario. We show that the learned transformations greatly support the DPGMM sampler in finding better clusters, according to the performance of the DPGMM posteriorgrams on the ABX sound class discriminability task. We also introduce a method for combining posteriorgram outputs of multiple clusterings and demonstrate that such combinations can further improve sound class discriminability.","['https://openalex.org/W2118841860', 'https://openalex.org/W2114347655', 'https://openalex.org/W2117041980', 'https://openalex.org/W2126203737', 'https://openalex.org/W2119187236', 'https://openalex.org/W1796128977', 'https://openalex.org/W2396043527', 'https://openalex.org/W2404799143', 'https://openalex.org/W1997505733', 'https://openalex.org/W2399576818', 'https://openalex.org/W2001619934', 'https://openalex.org/W2124629003', 'https://openalex.org/W2106554350', 'https://openalex.org/W4302557958', 'https://openalex.org/W2002342963', 'https://openalex.org/W2064210461', 'https://openalex.org/W2402014506', 'https://openalex.org/W2128032727', 'https://openalex.org/W2145410271', 'https://openalex.org/W2044138293', 'https://openalex.org/W2395899413', 'https://openalex.org/W2294798173', 'https://openalex.org/W2071128523', 'https://openalex.org/W2963620343', 'https://openalex.org/W1524333225', 'https://openalex.org/W66167291']",2017-12-31

However, there are several drawbacks in the end-to-end ASR model training where the current time-step prediction on the target side are conditioned with the ground truth transcription and speech features. In the inference stage, the condition is different because the model does not have any access to the target sequence ground-truth, thus any mistakes might be accumulated and degrade the decoding result over time. Another issue is raised because of the discrepancy between training and evaluation objective. In the training stage, maximum likelihood estimation criterion is used as the objective function. However, the ASR systems quality is evaluated based on the word error rate via Levenshtein distance. Therefore, we present an alternative for optimizing end-to-end ASR model with one of the reinforcement learning method called policy gradient. The model trained the proposed approach has several advantages: (1) the model simulates the inference stage by free sampling process and uses its own sample as the input, and; (2) optimize the model with a reward function correlated with the ASR evaluation metric (e.g., negative Levenshtein distance). Based on the result from our experiment, our proposed method significantly improve the model performance compared to a model trained only with teacher forcing and maximum likelihood objective function.","['https://openalex.org/W6630875275', 'https://openalex.org/W6640185926', 'https://openalex.org/W6736996214', 'https://openalex.org/W1895577753', 'https://openalex.org/W6745628346', 'https://openalex.org/W6745177358', 'https://openalex.org/W2016589492', 'https://openalex.org/W2119717200', 'https://openalex.org/W32403112', 'https://openalex.org/W2526425061', 'https://openalex.org/W2129142580', 'https://openalex.org/W6631190155', 'https://openalex.org/W1977655452', 'https://openalex.org/W3211848854', 'https://openalex.org/W2963167310', 'https://openalex.org/W6677929280', 'https://openalex.org/W2145339207', 'https://openalex.org/W2963929190', 'https://openalex.org/W6898505805', 'https://openalex.org/W2024490156', 'https://openalex.org/W4205130185', 'https://openalex.org/W6679436768', 'https://openalex.org/W2327501763', 'https://openalex.org/W6676023451', 'https://openalex.org/W2963144852', 'https://openalex.org/W2144499799', 'https://openalex.org/W2064675550', 'https://openalex.org/W2160815625', 'https://openalex.org/W2962826786', 'https://openalex.org/W2892124901', 'https://openalex.org/W6679434410', 'https://openalex.org/W6631362777', 'https://openalex.org/W2076063813', 'https://openalex.org/W6685322675', 'https://openalex.org/W2963463964', 'https://openalex.org/W6738974909', 'https://openalex.org/W6683794156', 'https://openalex.org/W2257979135', 'https://openalex.org/W1515851193', 'https://openalex.org/W2163068732', 'https://openalex.org/W2962765220', 'https://openalex.org/W2964308564', 'https://openalex.org/W2133564696', 'https://openalex.org/W2962759037', 'https://openalex.org/W1921523184', 'https://openalex.org/W2130942839', 'https://openalex.org/W1916559533', 'https://openalex.org/W2525778437', 'https://openalex.org/W2142416747', 'https://openalex.org/W1524333225', 'https://openalex.org/W2963609956', 'https://openalex.org/W2101105183', 'https://openalex.org/W1522301498', 'https://openalex.org/W2108682071', 'https://openalex.org/W2952264928', 'https://openalex.org/W1514535095', 'https://openalex.org/W2176263492']",2019-01-01

We generate the sub-word units with a modified version of our speaker diarization system. Given a speech recording, the original diarization system generates a set of speaker models in an unsupervised manner without the need for training or development data. Modifying the diarization system to process the speech of a single speaker and decreasing the minimum segment duration constraint allows us to detect speaker-dependent sub-word units. For the task of query-by-example spoken term detection, we show that the pro posed system performs well on both broadcast and non-broadcast recordings, unlike a conventional phone-based system trained solely on broadcast data.

In either case, performance of automatic speech segmentation algorithms is often measured using automated evaluation algorithms and used to optimize a segmentation system’s performance. However, evaluation approaches reported in literature were found to be lacking. Also, we have determined that increases in phone boundary location detection rates are often due to increased over-segmentation levels and not to algorithmic improvements, i.e., by simply adding random boundaries a better hit-rate can be achieved when using current quality measures. Since established measures were found to be insensitive to this type of random boundary insertion, a new R-value quality measure is introduced that indicates how close a segmentation algorithm’s performance is to an ideal point of operation.","['https://openalex.org/W1720037957', 'https://openalex.org/W2174992124', 'https://openalex.org/W1994737544', 'https://openalex.org/W2171700247', 'https://openalex.org/W2098363562', 'https://openalex.org/W1589615572', 'https://openalex.org/W2069732686', 'https://openalex.org/W59175527', 'https://openalex.org/W4285719527', 'https://openalex.org/W2107105119', 'https://openalex.org/W2083904075', 'https://openalex.org/W2116697043', 'https://openalex.org/W2114259387']",2009-09-06

For this new setting, we require a framework for evaluating the quality of speech representations without coupling to a particular recognition architecture. Motivated by the spoken term discovery task, we present a dynamic time warping-based framework for quantifying how well a representation can associate words of the same type spoken by different speakers. We benchmark the quality of a wide range of speech representations using multiple frame-level distance metrics and demonstrate that our performance metrics can also accurately predict phone recognition accuracies.","['https://openalex.org/W30845872', 'https://openalex.org/W1980501707', 'https://openalex.org/W1539935047', 'https://openalex.org/W118636537', 'https://openalex.org/W2027499299', 'https://openalex.org/W197151588', 'https://openalex.org/W2113932204', 'https://openalex.org/W2114347655', 'https://openalex.org/W1606268232', 'https://openalex.org/W2079460648']",2011-08-27

It has been hypothesized that distributional regularities in spoken languages are strong enough to elicit statistical learning about dependencies among speech units. Distributional regularities could be a useful cue for word learning even without rich language‐specific knowledge. However, it is not clear how strong and reliable the distributional cues are that humans might use to segment speech. We investigate cross‐linguistic viability of different statistical learning strategies by analyzing child‐directed speech corpora from nine languages and by modeling possible statistics‐based speech segmentations. We show that languages vary as to which statistical segmentation strategies are most successful. The variability of the results can be partially explained by systematic differences between languages, such as rhythmical differences. The results confirm previous findings that different statistical learning strategies are successful in different languages and suggest that infants may have to primarily rely on non‐statistical cues when they begin their process of speech segmentation.","['https://openalex.org/W1971245457', 'https://openalex.org/W2161922070', 'https://openalex.org/W2157262267', 'https://openalex.org/W2029948425', 'https://openalex.org/W2159637323', 'https://openalex.org/W1997218510', 'https://openalex.org/W1500689260', 'https://openalex.org/W2092975057', 'https://openalex.org/W2130518563', 'https://openalex.org/W2122739034', 'https://openalex.org/W1967642969', 'https://openalex.org/W2124235535', 'https://openalex.org/W2126377586', 'https://openalex.org/W1990486914', 'https://openalex.org/W4251556668', 'https://openalex.org/W2118599126', 'https://openalex.org/W2162367254', 'https://openalex.org/W1573928862', 'https://openalex.org/W2076111237', 'https://openalex.org/W2157149948', 'https://openalex.org/W2124973255', 'https://openalex.org/W2059824090', 'https://openalex.org/W2132573777', 'https://openalex.org/W1990397005', 'https://openalex.org/W4388346736', 'https://openalex.org/W2339004230', 'https://openalex.org/W1566018662', 'https://openalex.org/W2092567368', 'https://openalex.org/W2080876739', 'https://openalex.org/W3209469015', 'https://openalex.org/W2097335727', 'https://openalex.org/W2071815064', 'https://openalex.org/W4214853963', 'https://openalex.org/W2095908250', 'https://openalex.org/W2008122551', 'https://openalex.org/W1996171054', 'https://openalex.org/W1980862600', 'https://openalex.org/W2081357278', 'https://openalex.org/W2115867364', 'https://openalex.org/W2136549906', 'https://openalex.org/W1967421273', 'https://openalex.org/W1977881723', 'https://openalex.org/W2119863209', 'https://openalex.org/W2543796155', 'https://openalex.org/W2061094331', 'https://openalex.org/W1822165271', 'https://openalex.org/W2098717046', 'https://openalex.org/W2153592339', 'https://openalex.org/W1593045043', 'https://openalex.org/W2115197214', 'https://openalex.org/W1991865342', 'https://openalex.org/W2142111485', 'https://openalex.org/W2541409095', 'https://openalex.org/W2142375640', 'https://openalex.org/W2912372357', 'https://openalex.org/W2968573267', 'https://openalex.org/W1660390307', 'https://openalex.org/W2166061736', 'https://openalex.org/W2914753947', 'https://openalex.org/W2331834237', 'https://openalex.org/W2137279763', 'https://openalex.org/W2030931431', 'https://openalex.org/W2167834252', 'https://openalex.org/W2333916262', 'https://openalex.org/W2321033554', 'https://openalex.org/W2159772141', 'https://openalex.org/W205757930', 'https://openalex.org/W2082859819', 'https://openalex.org/W803770162']",2016-05-04

Some studies suggest that infants are able to discover word boundaries at the points of high unpredictability across subsequent linguistic units such as phonemes or syllables. Meanwhile, the possible role of the statistical regularities in the temporal organization of the speech at a pre-linguistic acoustic level has not been widely addressed. The current work examines how the short-term temporal predictability of the acoustic speech signal correlates with linguistically motivated phone-, syllable-, and word-level units. The results indicate that the points of low predictability correlate mainly with the boundaries between phone-like segments. This suggests that the same statistical learning mechanisms hypothesized to operate at the word level can also aid in temporal organization of the speech stream into phone-like temporal segments before knowing the phonemic or syllabic units of the language. Keywords: distributional learning; language acquisition; phone segmentation; speech segmentation; statistical learning Introduction Segmentation of continuous speech into linguistically relevant units is essential for successful language acquisition (LA). Segmentation can take place at a number of levels, as the speech can be linguistically characterized in terms of units such as phones, syllables, and words, and with the latter always consisting of the former. In the early LA research, infants’ ability to segment words from speech has received a large amount of attention as the words are the main functional units of the language, standing for entities, events, actions, and states of the surrounding world. In the word segmentation studies, one of the major findings is that the infants can use statistical regularities in the speech input in order to discover boundaries between words (Saffran, Aslin & Newport, 1996). Also, these statistical learning mechanisms do not seem to be specific to words or even language faculty but operate across many levels of representation and perceptual domains (see, e.g., Romberg & Saffran, 2010, for a recent review). Importantly, a large body of the existing work on statistical word learning assumes that the infants are capable of representing speech input in terms of linguistically relevant units such as phones or syllables. Given the representational units, the infants are supposedly tracking transitional probabilities (TPs) between these units across time and use low-probability transitions as indications for word boundaries while the high-probability regions form representational units (Saffran et al., 1996). This strategy is valid as long as the TPs within words are higher than the TPs across word boundaries. However, the infant’s access to linguistic units such as phones or syllables and their statistics cannot be taken for granted. It is still unclear whether early adaptation to phonetic units drives lexical learning (c.f., NLM-e theory by Kuhl et al., 2008) or whether early lexical learning actually precedes, or at least parallels, the acquisition of sub-word representation of spoken language (e.g., Werker & Curtin, 2005). The “sub- word units –first” approach is challenged by the fact that the bottom-up organization of speech signal into temporally and categorically discrete units is far from trivial. Learning a phonetic or syllabic representation of the spoken language includes both the segmentation problem (division of the signal in time) and the categorization problem (assigning context-, talker-, and speaking style-dependent acoustic observations into a correct number of linguistic categories). Importantly, infants do not have access to any ground truth in either of the two tasks while learning the native language, suggesting that some speech-external factors such as feedback from lexical level or social interaction are required for successful learning. Still, it seems that even the basic problem of segmenting speech into sub-word units has been largely overlooked in the existing LA research. For example, it is unclear how well natural co-articulated speech can be segmented into sub-word units before learning the phonetic or lexical units of the language, and whether infants actually do such segmentation. Possibly the most concrete reference to early sub-word segmentation in the existing literature is the Kuhl’s concept of basic cuts: a perceptual mechanism that provides an initial low-level chunking of the speech stream into primitive phone-like units and which then gradually improves towards native language phone system through language exposure (Kuhl, 2004, and references therein). Segmentation into syllabic units is also central to many theories of LA (e.g., Jusczyk, 1993) although explicit and well-controlled studies on the segmentation process itself are few. In the speech engineering community, both phone- and syllable-level segmentation have been widely studied. The general finding is that the spectral changes (or “jumps”) in speech are good candidates for phone boundaries as they correlate with the changes in articulator positions (e.g., Almpanidis & Kotropulos, 2008; Esposito & Aversano, 2005; ten Bosch & Cranen, 2007; Scharenborg et al., 2007). On the other hand, it is known that syllabic segmentation","['https://openalex.org/W1911232923', 'https://openalex.org/W1589615572', 'https://openalex.org/W1993984071', 'https://openalex.org/W52412328', 'https://openalex.org/W2020944885', 'https://openalex.org/W3127686677', 'https://openalex.org/W2104752510', 'https://openalex.org/W2398858142', 'https://openalex.org/W2053952913', 'https://openalex.org/W2103091632', 'https://openalex.org/W2089883580', 'https://openalex.org/W2114777034', 'https://openalex.org/W135984148', 'https://openalex.org/W2010188467', 'https://openalex.org/W638114908', 'https://openalex.org/W1991274470', 'https://openalex.org/W1606268232', 'https://openalex.org/W2174992124']",2014-01-01

In this article, we propose a framework based on deep architectures (e. g. Deep Neural Networks) in order to deal with this issue. Deep architectures have proven to be efficient for high dimensional input problems such as image classification, due to their ability to embed the input space. The main contribution of this article is the extension of the embedding procedure to both the input and output spaces to easily handle complex outputs. Using this extension, inter-output dependencies can be modelled efficiently. This provides an interesting alternative to probabilistic models such as HMM and CRF.

But conventional codecs usually need a high bit-rate to achieve reconstructed speech with reasonable high quality. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end neural generative codec with a VQ-VAE based auto-encoder and the generative adversarial network (GAN), which achieves reconstructed speech with high-fidelity at a low bit-rate about 2 kb/s. The compression process of speech coding is carried out by a down-sampling module of the encoder and a learnable discrete codebook. GAN is used to further improve the reconstructed quality. Our experiments confirm the effectiveness of the proposed model in both objective and subjective tests, which significantly outperforms the conventional codecs at low bit-rate in terms of speech quality and speaker similarity.","['https://openalex.org/W3160576174', 'https://openalex.org/W3016003977', 'https://openalex.org/W2935711438', 'https://openalex.org/W2775336875', 'https://openalex.org/W2963208781', 'https://openalex.org/W2593414223', 'https://openalex.org/W2151409182', 'https://openalex.org/W2108532241', 'https://openalex.org/W2020883660', 'https://openalex.org/W1494198834', 'https://openalex.org/W1552314771', 'https://openalex.org/W1901129140', 'https://openalex.org/W3096468295', 'https://openalex.org/W3199364993', 'https://openalex.org/W2963091184', 'https://openalex.org/W2972519044', 'https://openalex.org/W3015338123', 'https://openalex.org/W3144035034']",2021-10-18

Recently, a more calculation efficient end-to-end architecture named transformer, which is solely based on self-attention, was proposed to model global dependencies between the input and output sequences. However, although with many advantages, transformer lacks position information in its structure. Moreover, the weighted sum form in self-attention may disperse the attention to the whole input sequence other than focusing on the more important neighbouring positions. In order to solve the above problems, this paper introduces a hybrid self-attention structure which combines self-attention with the recurrent neural networks (RNNs). We further enhance the proposed structure with relative-position-aware biases. Mean opinion score (MOS) test results indicate that by enhancing hybrid self-attention structure with relative-position-aware biases, the proposed system achieves the best performance with only 0.11 MOS score lower than natural recording.","['https://openalex.org/W6745697700', 'https://openalex.org/W6737778391', 'https://openalex.org/W6739901393', 'https://openalex.org/W6754925833', 'https://openalex.org/W2964302946', 'https://openalex.org/W2963925437', 'https://openalex.org/W2962911926', 'https://openalex.org/W6753640285', 'https://openalex.org/W2964045208', 'https://openalex.org/W6679436768', 'https://openalex.org/W2043003570', 'https://openalex.org/W2515943672', 'https://openalex.org/W6679434410', 'https://openalex.org/W2963609956', 'https://openalex.org/W6756197946', 'https://openalex.org/W2102003408', 'https://openalex.org/W3142087749', 'https://openalex.org/W2767052532', 'https://openalex.org/W1902237438', 'https://openalex.org/W6746700228', 'https://openalex.org/W2749651610', 'https://openalex.org/W2613904329', 'https://openalex.org/W2949382160', 'https://openalex.org/W2959575783', 'https://openalex.org/W2964243274', 'https://openalex.org/W2133564696', 'https://openalex.org/W2892140764', 'https://openalex.org/W2766812927', 'https://openalex.org/W3026414669', 'https://openalex.org/W2884852625', 'https://openalex.org/W2130942839', 'https://openalex.org/W2519091744', 'https://openalex.org/W2963691546', 'https://openalex.org/W2963403868', 'https://openalex.org/W2866343820', 'https://openalex.org/W2964265128', 'https://openalex.org/W2964308564', 'https://openalex.org/W2903739847', 'https://openalex.org/W2933485668', 'https://openalex.org/W4385245566', 'https://openalex.org/W2901997113']",2019-04-17

It is shown that the cepstral measure bounds the rms log spectral measure from below, while the cosh measure bounds it from above. A simple nonlinear transformation of the likelihood ratio is shown to be highly correlated with the rms log spectral measure over expected ranges. Relationships between distance measure values and perception are also considered. The likelihood ratio, cepstral measure, and cosh measure are easily evaluated recursively from linear prediction filter coefficients, and each has a meaningful and interrelated frequency domain interpretation.

The earliest work in this area used a sophis-ticated set of pattern recognition algorithms in a human-interactive mode to create the set of templates (multiple patterns) for each word in the vocabulary. Not only was this procedure time consuming but was impossible to reproduce exactly because it was highly dependent on decisions made by the experimenter. Subsequent work led to an auto-matic clustering procedure which, given only a set of clustering param-eters, clustered patterns with the same performance as the previously developed supervised algorithms. The one drawback of the automatic procedure was that the specification of the input parameter set was found to be somewhat dependent on the vocabulary type and size of population to be clustered. Since a naive user of such a statistical clus-tering algorithm could not be expected, in general, to know how to choose the word clustering parameters, even this automatic clustering algorithm was not appropriate for a completely general word recogni-tion system. It is the purpose of this paper to present a clustering al-gorithm based on a standard K-means approach which requires no user parameter specification. Experimental data show that this new algo-rithm performs as well or better than the previously used clustering techniques when tested as part of a speaker-independent isolated word recognition system.

One of the major reasons why speech models, based on Markov chains, have not been developed until recently was the lack of a method for optimizing the parameters of the Markov model to match observed signal patterns. Such a method was proposed in the late 1960's and was immediately applied to speech processing in several research institutions. Continued refinements in the theory and implementation of Markov modelling techniques have greatly enhanced the method, leading to a wide range of applications of these models.

Central to this progress has been the development and application of mathematical methods that permit modeling the speech signal as a complex code with several coexisting levels of structure. The most successful of these are ""template matching,"" stochastic modeling, and probabilistic parsing. The manifestation of common themes such as dynamic programming and finite-state descriptions accentuates a superficial likeness amongst the methods which is often mistaken for the deeper similarity arising from their shared Bayesian foundation. In this paper, we outline the mathematical bases of these methods, invariant metrics, hidden Markov chains, and formal grammars, respectively. We then recount and briefly interpret the results of experiments in speech recognition to which the various methods were applied. Since these mathematical principles seem to bear little resemblance to traditional linguistic characterizations of speech, the success of the experiments is occasionally attributed, even by their authors, merely to excellent engineering. We conclude by speculating that, quite to the contrary, these methods actually constitute a powerful theory of speech that can be reconciled with and elucidate conventional linguistic theories while being used to build truly competent mechanical speech recognizers.","['https://openalex.org/W1687345816', 'https://openalex.org/W2070392176', 'https://openalex.org/W2096795584',

In this type of system the machine responds to the mode of communications preferred by the user, rather than vice versa. Many practical applications exist today for limited capability voice input systems. The first operational voice input systems have taken place with limited vocabulary, isolated word voice input systems. Most of these initial systems were for industrial applications in which the users' hands or eyes were already busy with their normal work requirements. Future developments in both new applications and increased capability voice input systems can be expected to considerably expand the usage of this form of man-machine communications.","['https://openalex.org/W1999847858', 'https://openalex.org/W2140886571', 'https://openalex.org/W2048205846', 'https://openalex.org/W2137089646', 'https://openalex.org/W1986092967', 'https://openalex.org/W2017688745', 'https://openalex.org/W1996746519', 'https://openalex.org/W2020637097', 'https://openalex.org/W2063223471', 'https://openalex.org/W2070392176', 'https://openalex.org/W4244497272', 'https://openalex.org/W2005080020', 'https://openalex.org/W1777419623', 'https://openalex.org/W1976882641', 'https://openalex.org/W1536990986', 'https://openalex.org/W2079690395', 'https://openalex.org/W2001850558', 'https://openalex.org/W1995405517', 'https://openalex.org/W2052774093', 'https://openalex.org/W275989656', 'https://openalex.org/W2525374352', 'https://openalex.org/W2091451843', 'https://openalex.org/W2035224173', 'https://openalex.org/W4285719527', 'https://openalex.org/W2083417201', 'https://openalex.org/W1807136877', 'https://openalex.org/W44681557', 'https://openalex.org/W2292185534']",1976-01-01

It is the purpose of this paper to outline two aspects of speech-recognition research. First, we discuss word recognition as a classical pattern-recognition problem and show how some fundamental concepts of signal processing, information theory, and computer science can be combined to give us the capability of robust recognition of isolated words and simple connected word sequences. We then describe methods whereby these principles, augmented by modern theories of formal language and semantic analysis, can be used to study some of the more general problems in speech recognition.

The earliest work in this area used a sophisticated set of pattern recognition algorithms in a human-interactive mode to create the set of templates (multiple patterns) for each word in the vocabulary. Not only was this procedure time consuming but it was impossible to reproduce exactly, because it was highly dependent on decisions made by the experimenter. Subsequent work led to an automatic clustering procedure which, given only a set of clustering parameters, clustered tokens with the same performance as the previously developed supervised algorithms. The one drawback of the automatic procedure was that the specification of the input parameter set was found to be somewhat dependent on the vocabulary type and size of population to be clustered. Since the user of such a statistical clustering algorithm could not be expected, in general, to know how to choose the word clustering parameters, even this automatic clustering algorithm was not appropriate for a completely general word recognition system. It is the purpose of this paper to present a new clustering algorithm based on a K-means approach which requires no user parameter specification. Experimental data show that this new algorithm performs as well or better than the previously used clustering techniques when tested as part of a speaker independent isolated word recognition system.",[],1984-05-01

Such systems usually comprise a network converting linguistic/phonetic features sequence to an acoustic features sequence, cascaded with a neural vocoder. The generated speech prosody (i.e. phoneme durations, pitch and loudness) is implicitly present in the acoustic features, being mixed with spectral information. Although the speech sounds natural, its prosody realization is randomly chosen and cannot be easily altered. The prosody control becomes an even more difficult task if no prosodic labeling is present in the training data. Recently, much progress has been achieved in unsupervised speaking style learning and generation, however human inspection is still required after the training for discovery and interpretation of the speaking styles learned by the system. In this work we introduce a fully automatic method that makes the system aware of the prosody and enables sentence-wise speaking pace and expressiveness control on a continuous scale. While being useful by itself in many applications, the proposed prosody control can also improve the overall quality and expressiveness of the synthesized speech, as demonstrated by subjective listening evaluations. We also propose a novel augmented attention mechanism, that facilitates better pace control sensitivity and faster attention convergence.",[],2019-09-14

However, many approaches cause a sequence-to-sequence model to generate only averaged results of the input text, making it difficult to control the duration of utterance. In this study, we present a novel mechanism for phonemic-level duration control (PDC) in a nearly end-to-end manner in order to solve this problem. We used a teacher attention alignment generated by an annotation speech analyzer program. Our method is inspired by the idea that the duration of a phoneme is highly related to its phonemic features. These phonemic features are saved on the attention alignment by adding duration embedding to it. This enables the model to learn and control the phonemic and rhythmic features of speech. We also show that providing alignment information as a teacher loss term improves training speed and notably, makes the model better at controlling the speed of dramatic change in phonemic-level duration with subjective demonstration. As a result, we show that our PDC speech synthesis with alignment loss outperforms other baseline methods without losing the ability to control the duration of phonemes in extremely adjusted environments with faster convergence.","['https://openalex.org/W2963971656', 'https://openalex.org/W6734815144', 'https://openalex.org/W6738277540', 'https://openalex.org/W2795109282', 'https://openalex.org/W6750489868', 'https://openalex.org/W6630875275', 'https://openalex.org/W2327501763', 'https://openalex.org/W6756197946', 'https://openalex.org/W2399979888', 'https://openalex.org/W2750077311', 'https://openalex.org/W6917585676', 'https://openalex.org/W2608207374', 'https://openalex.org/W2120847449', 'https://openalex.org/W2962902328', 'https://openalex.org/W1902237438', 'https://openalex.org/W6679434410', 'https://openalex.org/W2102003408', 'https://openalex.org/W6843615328', 'https://openalex.org/W6640090968', 'https://openalex.org/W2515943672', 'https://openalex.org/W6679436768', 'https://openalex.org/W6749489859', 'https://openalex.org/W6843673214', 'https://openalex.org/W6753855596', 'https://openalex.org/W6746700228', 'https://openalex.org/W2914049472', 'https://openalex.org/W2767052532', 'https://openalex.org/W2251701780', 'https://openalex.org/W2619368999', 'https://openalex.org/W2963782041', 'https://openalex.org/W2963975282', 'https://openalex.org/W2133564696', 'https://openalex.org/W2901997113', 'https://openalex.org/W2794490148', 'https://openalex.org/W2963927338', 'https://openalex.org/W2949382160', 'https://openalex.org/W4300416988', 'https://openalex.org/W2963691546', 'https://openalex.org/W4294619240', 'https://openalex.org/W2591927543', 'https://openalex.org/W2519091744', 'https://openalex.org/W1922655562', 'https://openalex.org/W4295731579', 'https://openalex.org/W2963712897', 'https://openalex.org/W1514535095', 'https://openalex.org/W2964308564', 'https://openalex.org/W2963609956', 'https://openalex.org/W2130942839', 'https://openalex.org/W2964243274']",2019-04-17

The system is composed of an autoregressive attention-based sequence-to-sequence acoustic model and the LPCNet vocoder for waveform generation. An acoustic model architecture that adopts modules from both the Tacotron 1 and 2 models is proposed, while stability is ensured by using a recently proposed purely location-based attention mechanism, suitable for arbitrary sentence length generation. During inference, the decoder is unrolled and acoustic feature generation is performed in a streaming manner, allowing for a nearly constant latency which is independent from the sentence length. Experimental results show that the acoustic model can produce feature sequences with minimal latency about 31 times faster than real-time on a computer CPU and 6.5 times on a mobile CPU, enabling it to meet the conditions required for real-time applications on both devices. The full end-to-end system can generate almost natural quality speech, which is verified by listening tests.","['https://openalex.org/W2964243274', 'https://openalex.org/W1522301498', 'https://openalex.org/W2767052532', 'https://openalex.org/W2949382160', 'https://openalex.org/W2963975282', 'https://openalex.org/W2963609956', 'https://openalex.org/W2963300588', 'https://openalex.org/W4294619240', 'https://openalex.org/W2962970071', 'https://openalex.org/W3015338123', 'https://openalex.org/W4385245566', 'https://openalex.org/W2996286887', 'https://openalex.org/W3038172701', 'https://openalex.org/W854541894', 'https://openalex.org/W2519091744', 'https://openalex.org/W2963403868', 'https://openalex.org/W2964121744', 'https://openalex.org/W2970971581', 'https://openalex.org/W4295312788', 'https://openalex.org/W2903739847', 'https://openalex.org/W3095459301', 'https://openalex.org/W4293714597', 'https://openalex.org/W2963091184', 'https://openalex.org/W3015922793', 'https://openalex.org/W2970006822', 'https://openalex.org/W2946200149', 'https://openalex.org/W2970730223', 'https://openalex.org/W4298580827', 'https://openalex.org/W3016160783', 'https://openalex.org/W2963691546', 'https://openalex.org/W2948211236', 'https://openalex.org/W2095705004', 'https://openalex.org/W1810943226', 'https://openalex.org/W2964307104', 'https://openalex.org/W2963782041']",2020-10-25

When it is tested for periodic signals and for signals with additive noise or jitter, it proves to be several orders of magnitude more accurate than the methods commonly used for speech analysis. This makes our method capable of measuring harmonics-to-noise ratios in the lag domain with an accuracy and reliability much greater than that of any of the usual frequency-domain methods. By definition, the best candidate for the acoustic pitch period of a sound can be found from the position of the maximum of the autocorrelation function of the sound, while the degree of periodicity (the harmonics-to-noise ratio) of the sound can be found from the relative height of this maximum. However, sampling and windowing cause problems in accurately determining the position and height of the maximum. These problems have led to inaccurate timedomain and cepstral methods for pitch detection, and to the exclusive use of frequency-domain methods for the determination of the harmonics-to-noise ratio.","['https://openalex.org/W2138039466', 'https://openalex.org/W2003820141', 'https://openalex.org/W1964546269', 'https://openalex.org/W2043580765', 'https://openalex.org/W2110392754', 'https://openalex.org/W2084044763', 'https://openalex.org/W3005283740', 'https://openalex.org/W2341283081']",1993-01-01

The main idea is to incorporate well-known acoustic correlates of prosody such as pitch and loudness contours of the reference speech into a modern neural text-to-speech (TTS) synthesizer such as Tacotron2 (TC2). More specifically, a small set of acoustic features are extracted from reference audio and then used to condition a TC2 synthesizer. The trained model is evaluated using subjective listening tests and a novel objective evaluation of prosody transfer is proposed. Listening tests show that the synthesized speech is rated as highly natural and that prosody is successfully transferred from the reference speech signal to the synthesized signal.","['https://openalex.org/W2963272440', 'https://openalex.org/W2608207374', 'https://openalex.org/W2945544731', 'https://openalex.org/W2952269766', 'https://openalex.org/W2963712897', 'https://openalex.org/W1524333225', 'https://openalex.org/W2889092828', 'https://openalex.org/W2494980014', 'https://openalex.org/W2963568578', 'https://openalex.org/W83586041', 'https://openalex.org/W2973158936', 'https://openalex.org/W2964307104', 'https://openalex.org/W2156146072', 'https://openalex.org/W2171121512', 'https://openalex.org/W2981934523', 'https://openalex.org/W2962691331', 'https://openalex.org/W2964138190', 'https://openalex.org/W2085628288', 'https://openalex.org/W2400063444', 'https://openalex.org/W2964243274', 'https://openalex.org/W2795109282', 'https://openalex.org/W2963534259']",2019-11-21

Much of this work is based on literary theories, put forward by some of the most eminent philosophers and thinkers of all times, or medical theories, investigating the impact of humor on brain activity or behaviour. Recent functional neuroimaging studies, for instance, have investigated the process of comprehending and appreciating humor by examining functional activity in distinctive regions of brains stimulated by joke corpora. Yet, there is precious little work on the computational side, possibly due to the less hilarious nature of computer scientists as compared to men of letters and sawbones. In this paper, we set to investigate whether literary theories of humour can stand the test of algorithmic laughter. Or, in other words, we ask ourselves the vexed question: Can machines laugh? We attempt to answer that question by testing whether an algorithm - namely, a neural network - can ""understand"" humour, and in particular whether it is possible to automatically identify abstractions that are predicted to be relevant by established literary theories about the mechanisms of humor. Notice that we do not focus here on distinguishing humorous from serious statements - a feat that is clearly way beyond the capabilities of the average human voter, not to mention the average machine - but rather on identifying the underlying mechanisms and triggers that are postulated to exist by literary theories, by verifying if similar mechanisms can be learned by machines.","['https://openalex.org/W1525783482', 'https://openalex.org/W2064675550', 'https://openalex.org/W2131462252', 'https://openalex.org/W1579853615', 'https://openalex.org/W1632114991', 'https://openalex.org/W2170942820', 'https://openalex.org/W2949305281', 'https://openalex.org/W1507680813', 'https://openalex.org/W2112656927', 'https://openalex.org/W2079735306', 'https://openalex.org/W2058641082', 'https://openalex.org/W1554663460', 'https://openalex.org/W2108677974', 'https://openalex.org/W2152550252', 'https://openalex.org/W44815768', 'https://openalex.org/W2135341757', 'https://openalex.org/W2120861206', 'https://openalex.org/W196214544', 'https://openalex.org/W134527144', 'https://openalex.org/W2107878631', 'https://openalex.org/W1828163288', 'https://openalex.org/W1964175594', 'https://openalex.org/W1674799117', 'https://openalex.org/W2962968839', 'https://openalex.org/W3023071679', 'https://openalex.org/W2161628678', 'https://openalex.org/W2143612262', 'https://openalex.org/W32508012', 'https://openalex.org/W2147568880', 'https://openalex.org/W2115096495']",2016-01-01

In this paper, we propose embedding capacity (the amount of information the embedding contains about the data) as a unified method of analyzing the behavior of latent variable models of speech, comparing existing heuristic (non-variational) methods to variational methods that are able to explicitly constrain capacity using an upper bound on representational mutual information. In our proposed model (Capacitron), we show that by adding conditional dependencies to the variational posterior such that it matches the form of the true posterior, the same model can be used for high-precision prosody transfer, text-agnostic style transfer, and generation of natural-sounding prior samples. For multi-speaker models, Capacitron is able to preserve target speaker identity during inter-speaker prosody transfer and when drawing samples from the latent prior. Lastly, we introduce a method for decomposing embedding capacity hierarchically across two sets of latents, allowing a portion of the latent variability to be specified and the remaining variability sampled from a learned prior.

We investigate whether we can construct an adaptive signal processing device that learns by example how to generate new instances of a given musical style. Because recurrent neural networks (RNNs) can, in principle, learn the temporal structure of a signal, they are good candidates for such a task. Unfortunately, music composed by standard RNNs often lacks global coherence. The reason for this failure seems to be that RNNs cannot keep track of temporally distant events that indicate global music structure. Long short-term memory (LSTM) has succeeded in similar domains where other RNNs have failed, such as timing and counting and the learning of context sensitive languages. We show that LSTM is also a good mechanism for learning to compose music. We present experimental results showing that LSTM successfully learns a form of blues music and is able to compose novel (and we believe pleasing) melodies in that style. Remarkably, once the network has found the relevant structure, it does not drift from it: LSTM is able to play the blues with good timing and proper structure as long as one is willing to listen.","['https://openalex.org/W6631636882', 'https://openalex.org/W2038111264', 'https://openalex.org/W2023425980', 'https://openalex.org/W2014978753', 'https://openalex.org/W6631321124', 'https://openalex.org/W2032197604', 'https://openalex.org/W2067621398', 'https://openalex.org/W1996579223', 'https://openalex.org/W1507589012', 'https://openalex.org/W2100649405', 'https://openalex.org/W2136848157', 'https://openalex.org/W2121029939', 'https://openalex.org/W1994629163', 'https://openalex.org/W6637157234', 'https://openalex.org/W1674799117', 'https://openalex.org/W2112349754', 'https://openalex.org/W2983025147', 'https://openalex.org/W1526055535', 'https://openalex.org/W1899504021']",2003-06-25

Yet, they still face an important challenge, that of long-term structure, which is key to conveying a sense of musical coherence. We present the MorpheuS music generation system designed to tackle this problem. MorpheuS' novel framework has the ability to generate polyphonic pieces with a given tension profile and long- and short-term repeated pattern structures. A mathematical model for tonal tension quantifies the tension profile and state-of-the-art pattern detection algorithms extract repeated patterns in a template piece. An efficient optimization metaheuristic, variable neighborhood search, generates music by assigning pitches that best fit the prescribed tension profile to the template rhythm while hard constraining long-term structure through the detected patterns. This ability to generate affective music with specific tension profile and long-term structure is particularly useful in a game or film music context.

https://openalex.org/W2336031501,,An Emotion-Based Method to Perform Algorithmic Composition,"The generative music using algorithmic composition techniques has been developed in many years. However it usually lacks of emotion-based mechanism to generate music with specific affective features. In this article the automated music algorithm will be performed based on Prof. Phil Winosr’s “MusicSculptor” software with proper emotion parameter mapping to drive the music content with specific context using various music pa-rameters distribution with different probability control, in order to generate the necessary music emotion automatically. When the emotion scenario varies, the generative music will be logically made via the emotion and context control based on the emotion music classification method. This innovative technique not only generates the emotion music according to the scenario, but also plays the different content of the music every time to make listeners feel “fresh”. The emotion music classification method and the automated music development can be analyzed as the reference for the input of the automated music program. The result shows the proposed method generating music emotions successfully such as happy, angry, sad, and joy, with the correspondent parameter mapping between music and emotion. Although this paper only demonstrates the possibility of emotion-based algorithmic composition, hopefully the proposed idea can be extended to apply into the fields including multimedia and game, to make the background music automatically generated any time according to the context changed by the interaction between human and machine.","['https://openalex.org/W599334349', 'https://openalex.org/W2131705633', 'https://openalex.org/W1866281937', 'https://openalex.org/W2153771043', 'https://openalex.org/W1594185851', 'https://openalex.org/W1528099392']",2013-01-01
https://openalex.org/W1983627329,https://doi.org/10.1037/1196-1961.51.4.336,An exploratory study of musical emotions and psychophysiology.,"A basic issue about musical emotions concerns whether music elicits emotional responses in listeners (the 'emotivist' position) or simply expresses emotions that listeners recognize in the music (the 'cognitivist' position). To address this, psychophysiological measures were recorded while listners heard two excerpts chosen to represent each of three emotions: sad, fear, and happy. The measures covered a fairly wide spectrum of cardiac, vascular, electrodermal, and respiratory functions. Other subjects indicated dynamic changes in emotions they experienced while listening to the music on one of four scales: sad, fear, happy, and tension. Both physiological and emotion judgements were made on a second-by-second basis. The physiological measures all showed a significant effect of music compared to the pre-music interval. A number of analyses, including correlations between physiology and emotion judgments, found significant differences among the excerpts. The sad excerpts produced the largest changes in heart rate, blood pressure, skin conductance and temperature. The fear excerpts produced the largest changes in blood transit time and amplitude. The happy excerpts produced the largest changes in the measures of respiration. These emotion-specific physiological changes only partially replicated those found for nonmusical emotions. The physiological effects of music observed generally support the emotivist view of musical emotions.","['https://openalex.org/W4285719527', 'https://openalex.org/W2014937798', 'https://openalex.org/W2156948210', 'https://openalex.org/W2346038918', 'https://openalex.org/W2344527636', 'https://openalex.org/W2019581685', 'https://openalex.org/W2092914491', 'https://openalex.org/W2314687552', 'https://openalex.org/W2129800229', 'https://openalex.org/W2102610783', 'https://openalex.org/W2045889034', 'https://openalex.org/W2141067536', 'https://openalex.org/W2135735899', 'https://openalex.org/W1976314757', 'https://openalex.org/W2316487833', 'https://openalex.org/W2146355519', 'https://openalex.org/W2049586113', 'https://openalex.org/W2024765709', 'https://openalex.org/W1642204535', 'https://openalex.org/W2128323795', 'https://openalex.org/W2030986414', 'https://openalex.org/W2155060818', 'https://openalex.org/W1988060680', 'https://openalex.org/W2001172750', 'https://openalex.org/W2016737068', 'https://openalex.org/W2061796073', 'https://openalex.org/W2169945686', 'https://openalex.org/W2010677453', 'https://openalex.org/W1975911018', 'https://openalex.org/W1999908431', 'https://openalex.org/W2144840087', 'https://openalex.org/W2046513060', 'https://openalex.org/W2490910133', 'https://openalex.org/W2023543171', 'https://openalex.org/W2167022271', 'https://openalex.org/W2079975276', 'https://openalex.org/W1991697485', 'https://openalex.org/W2162719613', 'https://openalex.org/W2043947177', 'https://openalex.org/W2045565604', 'https://openalex.org/W1591116857', 'https://openalex.org/W2042491873', 'https://openalex.org/W2013439958', 'https://openalex.org/W1555461790', 'https://openalex.org/W2061131717', 'https://openalex.org/W2006519813', 'https://openalex.org/W2023723978', 'https://openalex.org/W2045034970', 'https://openalex.org/W2150851753', 'https://openalex.org/W2137250552', 'https://openalex.org/W2339542104', 'https://openalex.org/W2137672845', 'https://openalex.org/W1612190970', 'https://openalex.org/W2986108748', 'https://openalex.org/W2164517627', 'https://openalex.org/W2110085568', 'https://openalex.org/W1553424343']",1997-12-01

https://openalex.org/W1976814248,https://doi.org/10.1525/mp.2004.22.1.15,The Feeling of Music Past: How Listeners Remember Musical Affect,"This study was conducted to determine how listeners derive global evaluations of past musical durations from moment-to-moment experience. Participants produced moment-to-moment affective intensity ratings by pressing a pressure-sensitive button while listening to various selections. They later reported the remembered affective intensity of each example. The data suggest that the assumption that remembered affect equals the sum of all momentary affects fundamentally misrepresents how listeners encode and label past affective experiences. The duration of particular rather than uniform episodes contributes minimally to remembered affect (duration neglect). Listeners rely on the peak of affective intensity during a selection, the last moment, and moments that are more emotionally intense than immediately previous moments to determine postperformance ratings. The peak proves to be the strongest predictor of remembered affect. We derive a formula that takes moment-to-moment experience as input and predicts how listeners will remember musical affect. The formula is a better predictor of postperformance affect than any other on-line characteristic considered. Last, the utility of the formula is demonstrated through a brief examination of compositional decisions in a string quartet movement by Borodin and one typical format of four-movement symphonies from the classical period.","['https://openalex.org/W1992616068', 'https://openalex.org/W4248374506', 'https://openalex.org/W2037993836', 'https://openalex.org/W2102610783', 'https://openalex.org/W2038865874', 'https://openalex.org/W1987183503', 'https://openalex.org/W4249867000', 'https://openalex.org/W1990614265', 'https://openalex.org/W4238095641', 'https://openalex.org/W2089867299', 'https://openalex.org/W1988166588', 'https://openalex.org/W2314687552', 'https://openalex.org/W1994865232', 'https://openalex.org/W4249165595', 'https://openalex.org/W2091449145', 'https://openalex.org/W2089278712', 'https://openalex.org/W1973893087', 'https://openalex.org/W2150851753', 'https://openalex.org/W2007082084', 'https://openalex.org/W2047432625', 'https://openalex.org/W2020974330', 'https://openalex.org/W2038007153', 'https://openalex.org/W2028555134', 'https://openalex.org/W1991754315', 'https://openalex.org/W2167022271', 'https://openalex.org/W2038481898', 'https://openalex.org/W2101240583', 'https://openalex.org/W1645964347', 'https://openalex.org/W2019305288', 'https://openalex.org/W44481585', 'https://openalex.org/W2014937798', 'https://openalex.org/W2083094773', 'https://openalex.org/W1923965623', 'https://openalex.org/W2023723978', 'https://openalex.org/W2505085393', 'https://openalex.org/W2034922209', 'https://openalex.org/W1977343123', 'https://openalex.org/W1666941850', 'https://openalex.org/W2127283001', 'https://openalex.org/W1642204535', 'https://openalex.org/W2500195762', 'https://openalex.org/W2004142478', 'https://openalex.org/W4213206451', 'https://openalex.org/W1988665788', 'https://openalex.org/W2322936702']",2004-01-01

We&amp;apos;ve made a real-time music generator that is designed around the concepts of valence and arousal, which are two components of certain models of emotion. When set to a desired valence and arousal, the algorithm plays music corresponding to the intersection of these two parameters. We designed our algorithm using psychological theory of emotion and parametrized features of music which have been tested for affect. The results are a modular algorithm design, in which our parameters can be implemented in other affective music algorithms. We describe our implementation of these parameters, and our strategy for manipulating the parameters to generate musical emotion. Finally we discuss possible applications for these techniques in the fields of the arts, medical systems, and research applications.

Voice also conveys personal information such as social status, personal traits, and the emotional state of the speaker. Mechanically, voice production involves complex fluid-structure interaction within the glottis and its control by laryngeal muscle activation. An important goal of voice research is to establish a causal theory linking voice physiology and biomechanics to how speakers use and control voice to communicate meaning and personal information. Establishing such a causal theory has important implications for clinical voice management, voice training, and many speech technology applications. This paper provides a review of voice physiology and biomechanics, the physics of vocal fold vibration and sound production, and laryngeal muscular control of the fundamental frequency of voice, vocal intensity, and voice quality. Current efforts to develop mechanical and computational models of voice production are also critically reviewed. Finally, issues and future challenges in developing a causal theory of voice production and perception are discussed.","['https://openalex.org/W2094982465', 'https://openalex.org/W2040575518',

In this paper, we offer contributions in both these areas to enable similar progress in audio modeling. First, we detail a powerful new WaveNet-style autoencoder model that conditions an autoregressive decoder on temporal codes learned from the raw audio waveform. Second, we introduce NSynth, a large-scale and high-quality dataset of musical notes that is an order of magnitude larger than comparable public datasets. Using NSynth, we demonstrate improved qualitative and quantitative performance of the WaveNet autoencoder over a well-tuned spectral autoencoder baseline. Finally, we show that the model learns a manifold of embeddings that allows for morphing between instruments, meaningfully interpolating in timbre to create new types of sounds that are realistic and expressive.","['https://openalex.org/W1502260477', 'https://openalex.org/W1566660863', 'https://openalex.org/W2949117887', 'https://openalex.org/W2139788486', 'https://openalex.org/W2559688696', 'https://openalex.org/W2949899814', 'https://openalex.org/W1878791236', 'https://openalex.org/W2560512785', 'https://openalex.org/W2475687244', 'https://openalex.org/W2132085292', 'https://openalex.org/W2522389179', 'https://openalex.org/W2335728318', 'https://openalex.org/W2432004435', 'https://openalex.org/W2145094598', 'https://openalex.org/W2108598243', 'https://openalex.org/W2949382160', 'https://openalex.org/W2953318193', 'https://openalex.org/W2076608692', 'https://openalex.org/W1556219185', 'https://openalex.org/W1607142029', 'https://openalex.org/W2584032004', 'https://openalex.org/W2120847449', 'https://openalex.org/W2293272996', 'https://openalex.org/W2119929864', 'https://openalex.org/W3118608800', 'https://openalex.org/W1522301498']",2017-04-05
https://openalex.org/W2164767140,https://doi.org/10.1121/1.407371,Isolating the dynamic attributes of musical timbrea),"Three experiments examined the dynamic attributes of timbre by evaluating the role of onsets in similarity judgments. In separate experiments, subjects heard complete orchestral instrument tones, the onsets of those tones, and tones with the onsets removed (‘‘remainders’’). Ratings for complete tones corresponded to those for onsets, indicating that the salient acoustic attributes for complete tones are present at the onset. Ratings for complete tones also corresponded to those for remainders, indicating that the salient attributes for complete tones are present also in the absence of onsets. Subsequent acoustic analyses demonstrated that this pattern of similarity was due to the centroid frequencies and amplitude envelopes of the tones. The results indicate that the dynamic attributes of timbre are not only present at the onset, but also throughout, and that multiple acoustic attributes may contribute to the same perceptual dimensions.","['https://openalex.org/W1995268113', 'https://openalex.org/W1970423186', 'https://openalex.org/W1986595194', 'https://openalex.org/W2016645383', 'https://openalex.org/W2169371330', 'https://openalex.org/W2105672294', 'https://openalex.org/W1973192023', 'https://openalex.org/W1500344824', 'https://openalex.org/W2432517183', 'https://openalex.org/W2079080230', 'https://openalex.org/W2152825437', 'https://openalex.org/W1986023967', 'https://openalex.org/W2319608925', 'https://openalex.org/W2115067604', 'https://openalex.org/W2406477717']",1993-11-01

It was found that initial transients were important for the identifiability of instrumental tones but their presence or absence did not influence the dimensional structure.

In this latent class weighted Euclidean model, the contribution to the distance function between two stimuli is per dimension weighted identically by all subjects in the same latent class. This model removes the rotational invariance of the classical multidimensional scaling model retaining psychologically meaningful dimensions, and drastically reduces the number of parameters in the traditional INDSCAL model. The probability density function for the data of a subject is posited to be a finite mixture of spherical multivariate normal densities.

We created an open dataset specifically for this experiment, containing recordings of nine vowels from multiple languages, sung by a female singer on all pitches in her vocal range in phonation modes breathy, neutral, flow (resonant) and pressed. The dataset is available under a Creative Commons license at http://www.proutskova.de/phonation-modes. First, glottal flow waveform is estimated via inverse filtering (IAIF) from audio recordings. Then six parameters of the glottal flow waveform are calculated. A 4-class Support Vector Machine classifier is constructed to separate these features into phonation mode classes. We automated the IAIF approach by computing the values of the input arguments – lip radiation and formant count – leading to the best-performing SVM classifiers (average classification accuracy over 60%), yielding a physical model for the articulation of the vowels. We examine the steps needed to generalize and extend the experimental work presented in this paper in order to apply this method in ethnomusicological investigations.

Individuals can differ in their repertoire of musical behaviours as well as in the level of skill they display for any single musical behaviour. The types of musical behaviours we refer to here are broad, ranging from performance on an instrument and listening expertise, to the ability to employ music in functional settings or to communicate about music. In this paper, we first describe the concept of 'musical sophistication' which can be used to describe the multi-faceted nature of musical expertise. Next, we develop a novel measurement instrument, the Goldsmiths Musical Sophistication Index (Gold-MSI) to assess self-reported musical skills and behaviours on multiple dimensions in the general population using a large Internet sample (n = 147,636). Thirdly, we report results from several lab studies, demonstrating that the Gold-MSI possesses good psychometric properties, and that self-reported musical sophistication is associated with performance on two listening tasks. Finally, we identify occupation, occupational status, age, gender, and wealth as the main socio-demographic factors associated with musical sophistication. Results are discussed in terms of theoretical accounts of implicit and statistical music learning and with regard to social conditions of sophisticated musical engagement.","['https://openalex.org/W2068085668', 'https://openalex.org/W2071715685', 'https://openalex.org/W2128251500', 'https://openalex.org/W2072061347', 'https://openalex.org/W2140149555',

However, the increasing complexity and number of parameters in modern synthesizers make them harder to master. Hence, the development of methods allowing to easily create and explore with synthesizers is a crucial need. Here, we introduce a novel formulation of audio synthesizer control. We formalize it as finding an organized latent audio space that represents the capabilities of a synthesizer, while constructing an invertible mapping to the space of its parameters. By using this formulation, we show that we can address simultaneously automatic parameter inference, macro-control learning and audio-based preset exploration within a single model. To solve this new formulation, we rely on Variational Auto-Encoders (VAE) and Normalizing Flows (NF) to organize and map the respective auditory and parameter spaces. We introduce the disentangling flows, which allow to perform the invertible mapping between separate latent spaces, while steering the organization of some latent dimensions to match target variation factors by splitting the objective as partial density evaluation. We evaluate our proposal against a large set of baseline models and show its superiority in both parameter inference and audio reconstruction. We also show that the model disentangles the major factors of audio variations as latent dimensions, that can be directly used as macro-parameters. We also show that our model is able to learn semantic controls of a synthesizer by smoothly mapping to its parameters. Finally, we discuss the use of our model in creative applications and its real-time implementation in Ableton Live","['https://openalex.org/W1663973292', 'https://openalex.org/W2951004968', 'https://openalex.org/W2560512785', 'https://openalex.org/W2791716806', 'https://openalex.org/W2963090522', 'https://openalex.org/W2055561493', 'https://openalex.org/W2399306074', 'https://openalex.org/W2810655876', 'https://openalex.org/W131146354', 'https://openalex.org/W2963047245', 'https://openalex.org/W2963746531', 'https://openalex.org/W2287082121', 'https://openalex.org/W2804722844', 'https://openalex.org/W2753738274', 'https://openalex.org/W2587284713', 'https://openalex.org/W2269892441']",2019-07-01

Addressing quality issues of current voice transformation algorithms in conjunction with properties of the speech production and speech perception systems we try to pave the way for more natural Voice Transformation algorithms in the future.

In this work, we introduce a hierarchical GST architecture with residuals to Tacotron, which learns multiple-level disentangled representations to model and control different style granularities in synthesized speech. We make hierarchical evaluations conditioned on individual tokens from different GST layers. As the number of layers increases, we tend to observe a coarse to fine style decomposition. For example, the first GST layer learns a good representation of speaker IDs while finer speaking style or emotion variations can be found in higher-level layers. Meanwhile, the proposed model shows good performance of style transfer.","['https://openalex.org/W2102003408', 'https://openalex.org/W2603120115', 'https://openalex.org/W2793479148', 'https://openalex.org/W2516321201', 'https://openalex.org/W6745232783', 'https://openalex.org/W2885800352', 'https://openalex.org/W2904459034', 'https://openalex.org/W2962691331', 'https://openalex.org/W2120847449', 'https://openalex.org/W6753855596', 'https://openalex.org/W2769810959', 'https://openalex.org/W6750489868', 'https://openalex.org/W2795109282', 'https://openalex.org/W2117475030', 'https://openalex.org/W7043748487', 'https://openalex.org/W2777302760', 'https://openalex.org/W2129142580', 'https://openalex.org/W6736996214', 'https://openalex.org/W6755300632', 'https://openalex.org/W2475998840', 'https://openalex.org/W6643482484', 'https://openalex.org/W2107860279', 'https://openalex.org/W2651834199', 'https://openalex.org/W2964243274', 'https://openalex.org/W2963272440', 'https://openalex.org/W1972420736', 'https://openalex.org/W2963927338', 'https://openalex.org/W2963568578', 'https://openalex.org/W2519091744', 'https://openalex.org/W4294619240', 'https://openalex.org/W2808706139', 'https://openalex.org/W2963975282', 'https://openalex.org/W2963609956', 'https://openalex.org/W2963432880', 'https://openalex.org/W2766406951', 'https://openalex.org/W2949382160', 'https://openalex.org/W2794490148', 'https://openalex.org/W4289383906', 'https://openalex.org/W4295731579', 'https://openalex.org/W2527729766', 'https://openalex.org/W4327693937', 'https://openalex.org/W2187089797']",2019-12-01

Our previous research verified the feasibility of GST-based emotional speech synthesis in an end-to-end text-to-speech synthesis framework. However, selecting appropriate reference audio (RA) signals to extract emotion embedding vectors to the specific types of target emotions remains problematic. To ameliorate the selection problem, we propose an effective way of generating emotion embedding vectors by utilizing the trained GSTs. By assuming that the trained GSTs represent an emotional vector space, we first investigate the distribution of all the training samples depending on the type of each emotion.

Deep Voice lays the groundwork for truly end-to-end neural speech synthesis. The system comprises five major building blocks: a segmentation model for locating phoneme boundaries, a grapheme-to-phoneme conversion model, a phoneme duration prediction model, a fundamental frequency prediction model, and an audio synthesis model. For the segmentation model, we propose a novel way of performing phoneme boundary detection with deep neural networks using connectionist temporal classification (CTC) loss. For the audio synthesis model, we implement a variant of WaveNet that requires fewer parameters and trains faster than the original. By using a neural network for each component, our system is simpler and more flexible than traditional text-to-speech systems, where each component requires laborious feature engineering and extensive domain expertise. Finally, we show that inference with our system can be performed faster than real time and describe optimized WaveNet inference kernels on both CPU and GPU that achieve up to 400x speedups over existing implementations.","['https://openalex.org/W2193413348', 'https://openalex.org/W2471520273', 'https://openalex.org/W2901997113', 'https://openalex.org/W2949640717', 'https://openalex.org/W2952436057', 'https://openalex.org/W2559246505', 'https://openalex.org/W2160473997', 'https://openalex.org/W2474388053', 'https://openalex.org/W1522301498', 'https://openalex.org/W2099057450', 'https://openalex.org/W2953331651', 'https://openalex.org/W1924770834', 'https://openalex.org/W2949382160', 'https://openalex.org/W1576227399', 'https://openalex.org/W2953318193', 'https://openalex.org/W2277265840', 'https://openalex.org/W2513051195', 'https://openalex.org/W1570629387', 'https://openalex.org/W1916501714', 'https://openalex.org/W650122064']",2017-02-25

It is based on the well-known autocorrelation method with a number of modifications that combine to prevent errors. The algorithm has several desirable features. Error rates are about three times lower than the best competing methods, as evaluated over a database of speech recorded together with a laryngograph signal. There is no upper limit on the frequency search range, so the algorithm is suited for high-pitched voices and music. The algorithm is relatively simple and may be implemented efficiently and with low latency, and it involves few parameters that must be tuned. It is based on a signal model (periodic signal) that may be extended in several ways to handle various forms of aperiodicity that occur in particular applications.

Given the linguistic diversity, high-quality and accessible Machine Translation (MT) systems are essential in a country like India. Prior to this work, there was (i) no parallel training data spanning all 22 languages, (ii) no robust benchmarks covering all these languages and containing content relevant to India, and (iii) no existing translation models which support all the 22 scheduled languages of India. In this work, we aim to address this gap by focusing on the missing pieces required for enabling wide, easy, and open access to good machine translation systems for all 22 scheduled Indian languages. We identify four key areas of improvement: curating and creating larger training datasets, creating diverse and high-quality benchmarks, training multilingual models, and releasing models with open access. Our first contribution is the release of the Bharat Parallel Corpus Collection (BPCC), the largest publicly available parallel corpora for Indic languages. BPCC contains a total of 230M bitext pairs, of which a total of 126M were newly added, including 644K manually translated sentence pairs created as part of this work. Our second contribution is the release of the first n-way parallel benchmark covering all 22 Indian languages, featuring diverse domains, Indian-origin content, and source-original test sets. Next, we present IndicTrans2, the first model to support all 22 languages, surpassing existing models on multiple existing and new benchmarks created as a part of this work.

The ability of deep neural networks to learn a sensible representation of words is one of the major reasons for this improvement. Despite machine translation using deep neural architecture is showing state-of-the-art results in translating European languages, we cannot directly apply these algorithms in Indian languages mainly because of two reasons: unavailability of the good corpus and Indian languages are morphologically rich. In this paper, we propose a neural machine translation (NMT) system for four language pairs: English–Malayalam, English–Hindi, English–Tamil, and English–Punjabi. We also collected sentences from different sources and cleaned them to make four parallel corpora for each of the language pairs, and then used them to model the translation system. The encoder network in the NMT architecture was designed with long short-term memory (LSTM) networks and bi-directional recurrent neural networks (Bi-RNN). Evaluation of the obtained models was performed both automatically and manually. For automatic evaluation, the bilingual evaluation understudy (BLEU) score was used, and for manual evaluation, three metrics such as adequacy, fluency, and overall ranking were used. Analysis of the results showed the presence of lengthy sentences in English–Malayalam, and the English–Hindi corpus affected the translation. Attention mechanism was employed with a view to addressing the problem of translating lengthy sentences (sentences contain more than 50 words), and the system was able to perceive long-term contexts in the sentences.","['https://openalex.org/W2595715041', 'https://openalex.org/W2048228344', 'https://openalex.org/W2303560477', 'https://openalex.org/W2186356919', 'https://openalex.org/W606759049', 'https://openalex.org/W2561899685', 'https://openalex.org/W585740886', 'https://openalex.org/W2130942839', 'https://openalex.org/W1595847159', 'https://openalex.org/W2186120430', 'https://openalex.org/W2097801708', 'https://openalex.org/W2467281805', 'https://openalex.org/W2131774270', 'https://openalex.org/W2152367404', 'https://openalex.org/W2340675944', 'https://openalex.org/W2574872930', 'https://openalex.org/W2550821151', 'https://openalex.org/W19526395', 'https://openalex.org/W3212092983', 'https://openalex.org/W2020015729', 'https://openalex.org/W2156984567', 'https://openalex.org/W2100480499', 'https://openalex.org/W1902237438', 'https://openalex.org/W2668208913', 'https://openalex.org/W2218202018', 'https://openalex.org/W1753482797', 'https://openalex.org/W1602767452', 'https://openalex.org/W2172140247', 'https://openalex.org/W1945115148', 'https://openalex.org/W1924770834', 'https://openalex.org/W2133564696', 'https://openalex.org/W2064675550', 'https://openalex.org/W2525778437', 'https://openalex.org/W2566490639', 'https://openalex.org/W2605140907', 'https://openalex.org/W2912889685', 'https://openalex.org/W1916559533', 'https://openalex.org/W2131060370', 'https://openalex.org/W2963212250', 'https://openalex.org/W2964308564']",2019-03-20

Arguably, these are due to uneven resource allocation and sub-optimal incentives to work on less resourced languages. To track and further incentivize the global development of equitable language technology, we introduce GlobalBench. Prior multilingual benchmarks are static and have focused on a limited number of tasks and languages. In contrast, GlobalBench is an ever-expanding collection that aims to dynamically track progress on all NLP datasets in all languages. Rather than solely measuring accuracy, GlobalBench also tracks the estimated per-speaker utility and equity of technology across all languages, providing a multi-faceted view of how language technology is serving people of the world. Furthermore, GlobalBench is designed to identify the most under-served languages, and rewards research efforts directed towards those languages. At present, the most under-served languages are the ones with a relatively high population, but nonetheless overlooked by composite multilingual benchmarks (like Punjabi, Portuguese, and Wu Chinese). Currently, GlobalBench covers 966 datasets in 190 languages, and has 1,128 system submissions spanning 62 languages.",[],2023-05-24

The performance of the present speech-to-text model relies upon the hyperparameters used in this research work. In this research work, it is shown that convolutional neural networks (CNNs) can model raw and tonal speech signals. Their performance is on par with existing recognition systems. This study extends the role of the CNN-based approach to robust and uncommon speech signals (tonal) using its own designed database for target research. The main objective of this research work was to develop a speech-to-text recognition system to recognize the tonal speech signals of Gurbani hymns using a CNN. Further, the CNN model, with six layers of 2DConv, 2DMax Pooling, and 256 dense layer units (Google’s TensorFlow service) was also used in this work, as well as Praat for speech segmentation. Feature extraction was enforced using the MFCC feature extraction technique, which extracts standard speech features and features of background music as well. Our study reveals that the CNN-based method for identifying tonal speech sentences and adding instrumental knowledge performs better than the existing and conventional approaches. The experimental results demonstrate the significant performance of the present CNN architecture by providing an 89.15% accuracy rate and a 10.56% WER for continuous and extensive vocabulary sentences of speech signals with different tones.","['https://openalex.org/W2951871139', 'https://openalex.org/W2981958259', 'https://openalex.org/W6687567705', 'https://openalex.org/W6754832338', 'https://openalex.org/W6697756902', 'https://openalex.org/W6729542162', 'https://openalex.org/W2037550275', 'https://openalex.org/W2161742217', 'https://openalex.org/W6703360075', 'https://openalex.org/W1995562189', 'https://openalex.org/W2566781703', 'https://openalex.org/W6703075364', 'https://openalex.org/W2912581782', 'https://openalex.org/W1972278020', 'https://openalex.org/W4221144554', 'https://openalex.org/W6795952400', 'https://openalex.org/W1555696814', 'https://openalex.org/W2962146825', 'https://openalex.org/W2997239896', 'https://openalex.org/W6729568197', 'https://openalex.org/W3187713544', 'https://openalex.org/W2787992438', 'https://openalex.org/W2103088716', 'https://openalex.org/W2515753980', 'https://openalex.org/W6677055868', 'https://openalex.org/W2091088554', 'https://openalex.org/W1520422233', 'https://openalex.org/W2024733869', 'https://openalex.org/W6697830260', 'https://openalex.org/W2885590625', 'https://openalex.org/W2551268863', 'https://openalex.org/W2112635125', 'https://openalex.org/W2335896301', 'https://openalex.org/W2962949934', 'https://openalex.org/W2338261539', 'https://openalex.org/W2894647744', 'https://openalex.org/W2304768685', 'https://openalex.org/W2308498479', 'https://openalex.org/W2551258216']",2022-06-19

Our experiments on Spanish-English translation show that self-supervised pre-training consistently improves model performance compared with multitask learning with an average 6.6-12.1 BLEU gain, and it can be further combined with data augmentation techniques that apply MT to create weakly supervised training data.

However, many people particularly those in least developed countries, are unable to reap the benefits due to lack of access to ICT but also due to lack of access to quality educational material. Additionally, in Punjab India, due to a shortage of resources and lack of infrastructure, the education system suffers from massive gaps including high student to teacher ratios, shortage of qualified teachers, and poor teacher training programs. This all has also been further exacerbated due to the COVID19 Pandemic as schools shut down globally and all teaching/learning activities moved online where possible or were canceled otherwise. In an effort to help relieve some of the burden on the Punjabi education system, and motivated by the proven efficiency of mother-tongue based education as well as the importance of visual-based learning, this paper introduces a pipeline for translating English educational videos into Punjabi equivalents which seeks to go beyond simple translation and in future iterations take into consideration the cultural needs of the learners in order to better connect them with the topics being taught. This pipeline is among a series of under construction pipelines aimed at translating English educational videos into other languages, dubbed as ClassRoute.","['https://openalex.org/W6781867862', 'https://openalex.org/W3036966439', 'https://openalex.org/W2055439081', 'https://openalex.org/W2114884426', 'https://openalex.org/W1972395797', 'https://openalex.org/W2003523075', 'https://openalex.org/W2084742732', 'https://openalex.org/W6963675136', 'https://openalex.org/W2765598583', 'https://openalex.org/W3158860828', 'https://openalex.org/W1964389215', 'https://openalex.org/W2016503558', 'https://openalex.org/W3126507491', 'https://openalex.org/W6786294857', 'https://openalex.org/W2991485441', 'https://openalex.org/W2598619133', 'https://openalex.org/W2994987178', 'https://openalex.org/W3089662918', 'https://openalex.org/W2803924230', 'https://openalex.org/W6746468368', 'https://openalex.org/W2798944620', 'https://openalex.org/W3158815815', 'https://openalex.org/W3046516384', 'https://openalex.org/W2102443632', 'https://openalex.org/W2792743482', 'https://openalex.org/W1844826643', 'https://openalex.org/W212028900', 'https://openalex.org/W2107753673', 'https://openalex.org/W3107173247', 'https://openalex.org/W3207728892', 'https://openalex.org/W2771735366']",2021-10-19

In this work, we aim to improve the NLU capabilities of Indic languages by making contributions along 3 important axes (i) monolingual corpora (ii) NLU testsets (iii) multilingual LLMs focusing on Indic languages. Specifically, we curate the largest monolingual corpora, IndicCorp, with 20.9B tokens covering 24 languages from 4 language families - a 2.3x increase over prior work, while supporting 12 additional languages. Next, we create a human-supervised benchmark, IndicXTREME, consisting of nine diverse NLU tasks covering 20 languages. Across languages and tasks, IndicXTREME contains a total of 105 evaluation sets, of which 52 are new contributions to the literature. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first effort towards creating a standard benchmark for Indic languages that aims to test the multilingual zero-shot capabilities of pretrained language models. Finally, we train IndicBERT v2, a state-of-the-art model supporting all the languages. Averaged across languages and tasks, the model achieves an absolute improvement of 2 points over a strong baseline.

Common Voice is designed for Automatic Speech Recognition purposes but can be useful in other domains (e.g. language identification). To achieve scale and sustainability, the Common Voice project employs crowdsourcing for both data collection and data validation. The most recent release includes 29 languages, and as of November 2019 there are a total of 38 languages collecting data. Over 50,000 individuals have participated so far, resulting in 2,500 hours of collected audio. To our knowledge this is the largest audio corpus in the public domain for speech recognition, both in terms of number of hours and number of languages. As an example use case for Common Voice, we present speech recognition experiments using Mozilla's DeepSpeech Speech-to-Text toolkit. By applying transfer learning from a source English model, we find an average Character Error Rate improvement of 5.99 +/- 5.48 for twelve target languages (German, French, Italian, Turkish, Catalan, Slovenian, Welsh, Irish, Breton, Tatar, Chuvash, and Kabyle).

We generate semi-random search phrases from language-specific Wikipedia data that are then used to retrieve videos from YouTube for 107 languages. Speech activity detection and speaker diarization are used to extract segments from the videos that contain speech. Post-filtering is used to remove segments from the database that are likely not in the given language, increasing the proportion of correctly labeled segments to 98%, based on crowd-sourced verification. The size of the resulting training set (VoxLingua107) is 6628 hours (62 hours per language on the average) and it is accompanied by an evaluation set of 1609 verified utterances. We use the data to build language recognition models for several spoken language identification tasks. Experiments show that using the automatically retrieved training data gives competitive results to using hand-labeled proprietary datasets.

https://openalex.org/W4293332626,https://doi.org/10.48550/arxiv.2208.11761,IndicSUPERB: A Speech Processing Universal Performance Benchmark for Indian languages,"A cornerstone in AI research has been the creation and adoption of standardized training and test datasets to earmark the progress of state-of-the-art models. A particularly successful example is the GLUE dataset for training and evaluating Natural Language Understanding (NLU) models for English. The large body of research around self-supervised BERT-based language models revolved around performance improvements on NLU tasks in GLUE. To evaluate language models in other languages, several language-specific GLUE datasets were created. The area of speech language understanding (SLU) has followed a similar trajectory. The success of large self-supervised models such as wav2vec2 enable creation of speech models with relatively easy to access unlabelled data. These models can then be evaluated on SLU tasks, such as the SUPERB benchmark. In this work, we extend this to Indic languages by releasing the IndicSUPERB benchmark. Specifically, we make the following three contributions. (i) We collect Kathbath containing 1,684 hours of labelled speech data across 12 Indian languages from 1,218 contributors located in 203 districts in India. (ii) Using Kathbath, we create benchmarks across 6 speech tasks: Automatic Speech Recognition, Speaker Verification, Speaker Identification (mono/multi), Language Identification, Query By Example, and Keyword Spotting for 12 languages. (iii) On the released benchmarks, we train and evaluate different self-supervised models alongside a commonly used baseline FBANK. We show that language-specific fine-tuned models are more accurate than baseline on most of the tasks, including a large gap of 76\% for the Language Identification task. However, for speaker identification, self-supervised models trained on large datasets demonstrate an advantage. We hope IndicSUPERB contributes to the progress of developing speech language understanding models for Indian languages.",[],2022-08-24

In this work, we propose to learn music genre-specific characteristics to train polyphonic acoustic models. We first compare several automatic speech recognition pipelines for the application of lyrics transcription. We then present the lyrics alignment and transcription performance of music-informed acoustic models for the best-performing pipeline, and systematically study the impact of music genre and language model on the performance. With such genre-based approach, we explicitly model the music without removing it during acoustic modeling. The proposed approach outperforms all competing systems in the lyrics alignment and transcription tasks on well-known polyphonic test datasets.","['https://openalex.org/W2606974598', 'https://openalex.org/W6637373629', 'https://openalex.org/W2962780374', 'https://openalex.org/W6629717138', 'https://openalex.org/W6627665034', 'https://openalex.org/W6732426729', 'https://openalex.org/W2972856300', 'https://openalex.org/W2917340025', 'https://openalex.org/W2340080546', 'https://openalex.org/W2973071600', 'https://openalex.org/W6741568435', 'https://openalex.org/W2903006902', 'https://openalex.org/W6746559740', 'https://openalex.org/W6675365184', 'https://openalex.org/W2327501763', 'https://openalex.org/W2766219058', 'https://openalex.org/W6683183305', 'https://openalex.org/W6713762819', 'https://openalex.org/W6604617924', 'https://openalex.org/W2888867175', 'https://openalex.org/W4235128394', 'https://openalex.org/W6712736788', 'https://openalex.org/W2889429804', 'https://openalex.org/W2935701729', 'https://openalex.org/W2098796164', 'https://openalex.org/W2104512693', 'https://openalex.org/W2320195920', 'https://openalex.org/W2134387846', 'https://openalex.org/W2133824856', 'https://openalex.org/W2144827818', 'https://openalex.org/W6745913901', 'https://openalex.org/W6751512325', 'https://openalex.org/W6631362777', 'https://openalex.org/W2158880150', 'https://openalex.org/W2407080277', 'https://openalex.org/W2736648940', 'https://openalex.org/W2102113734', 'https://openalex.org/W2774998006', 'https://openalex.org/W2057745663', 'https://openalex.org/W1494198834', 'https://openalex.org/W2963452667', 'https://openalex.org/W2769075302', 'https://openalex.org/W2398871418', 'https://openalex.org/W1686810756', 'https://openalex.org/W1524333225', 'https://openalex.org/W2577008904', 'https://openalex.org/W112239495', 'https://openalex.org/W1164175658']",2020-04-09

Different from the conventional SVS models, the proposed ByteSing employs Tacotron-like encoder-decoder structures as the acoustic models, in which the CBHG models and recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are explored as encoders and decoders respectively. Meanwhile an auxiliary phoneme duration prediction model is utilized to expand the input sequence, which can enhance the model controllable capacity, model stability and tempo prediction accuracy. WaveRNN vocoders are also adopted as neural vocoders to further improve the voice quality of synthesized songs. Both objective and subjective experimental results prove that the SVS method proposed in this paper can produce quite natural, expressive and high-fidelity songs by improving the pitch and spectrogram prediction accuracy and the models using attention mechanism can achieve best performance.","['https://openalex.org/W6745697700', 'https://openalex.org/W6771539914', 'https://openalex.org/W2973046048', 'https://openalex.org/W6763832098', 'https://openalex.org/W6767453231', 'https://openalex.org/W6769685950', 'https://openalex.org/W6772134836', 'https://openalex.org/W6748409065', 'https://openalex.org/W2963300588', 'https://openalex.org/W2921576841', 'https://openalex.org/W2043003570', 'https://openalex.org/W6761725420', 'https://openalex.org/W2515336442', 'https://openalex.org/W2963609956', 'https://openalex.org/W2889244839', 'https://openalex.org/W6601203246', 'https://openalex.org/W2964243274', 'https://openalex.org/W2972910332', 'https://openalex.org/W6638273328', 'https://openalex.org/W6625166683', 'https://openalex.org/W6731370813', 'https://openalex.org/W6769754352', 'https://openalex.org/W2971753973', 'https://openalex.org/W2567070169', 'https://openalex.org/W2766812927', 'https://openalex.org/W960890183', 'https://openalex.org/W3015499232', 'https://openalex.org/W2946200149', 'https://openalex.org/W2519091744', 'https://openalex.org/W2937242376', 'https://openalex.org/W2970730223', 'https://openalex.org/W2963970792', 'https://openalex.org/W4298580827', 'https://openalex.org/W3015922793', 'https://openalex.org/W2949382160', 'https://openalex.org/W2964307104', 'https://openalex.org/W29794711', 'https://openalex.org/W1810943226', 'https://openalex.org/W3096437652', 'https://openalex.org/W2995670387', 'https://openalex.org/W2408435475']",2021-01-24

Thissystem employs the HMM-based speech synthesis to synthesizesingingvoice. Musical information such aslyrics, tones, durationsis modeled simultaneously in a uniﬁed framework of the context-dependent HMM. It can mimic the voice quality and singing styleof the original singer. Results of a singing voice synthesis exper-iment show that the proposed system can synthesize smooth andnatural-sounding singing voice. Index Terms : singing voice synthesis, HMM, time-lag model. 1. Introduction In recent years, various applications of speech synthesis systemshave been proposed and investigated. Singing voice synthesis isone of the hot topics in this area [1–5]. However, only a fewcorpus-based singing voice synthesis systems which can be con-structed automatically have been proposed.Currently, there are two main paradigms in the corpus-basedspeech synthesis area: sample-based approach and statistical ap-proach. The sample-based approach such as unit selection [6]can synthesize high-quality speech. However, it requires a hugeamountoftrainingdatatorealizevariousvoicecharacteristics. Onthe other hand, the quality of statistical approach such as HMM-basedspeechsynthesis[7]isbuzzybecauseitisbasedonavocod-ingtechnique. However,itissmoothandstable,anditsvoicechar-acteristics can easily be modiﬁed by transforming HMM parame-ters appropriately. For singing voice synthesis, applying the unitselection seems to be difﬁcult because a huge amount of singingspeech which covers vast combinations of contextual factors thataffect singing voice has to be recorded. On the other hand, theHMM-based system can be constructed using a relatively smallamount of training data. From this point of view, the HMM-basedapproach seems to be more suitable for the singing voice synthe-sizer. In the present paper, we apply the HMM-based synthesisapproach to singing voice synthesis.Although the singing voice synthesis system proposed in thepresent paper is quite similar to the HMM-based text-to-speechsynthesissystem[7],therearetwomaindifferencesbetweenthem.In the HMM-based text-to-speech synthesis system, contextualfactors which may affect reading speech (e.g. phonemes, sylla-bles, words, phrases, etc.) are taken into account. However, con-textual factors which may affect singing voice should be different","['https://openalex.org/W1600722501', 'https://openalex.org/W2096801154', 'https://openalex.org/W2154920538', 'https://openalex.org/W1525613233', 'https://openalex.org/W182265564', 'https://openalex.org/W2096980176', 'https://openalex.org/W2150658333', 'https://openalex.org/W2093450784']",2006-09-17

Singing voice synthesis systems based on deep neural networks (DNNs) are currently being proposed and are improving the naturalness of synthesized singing voices. As singing voices represent a rich form of expression, a powerful technique to model them accurately is required. In the proposed technique, long-term dependencies of singing voices are modeled by CNNs. An acoustic feature sequence is generated for each segment that consists of long-term frames, and a natural trajectory is obtained without the parameter generation algorithm. Furthermore, a computational complexity reduction technique, which drives the DNNs in different time units depending on type of musical score features, is proposed.

These ""knees'' typically represent beneficial points that system designers have long selected to best balance inherent trade-offs. While prior work largely uses ad hoc, system-specific approaches to detect knees, we present Kneedle, a general approach to on line and off line knee detection that is applicable to a wide range of systems. We define a knee formally for continuous functions using the mathematical concept of curvature and compare our definition against alternatives.

Most previously suggested approaches to this problem are either somewhat ad hoc or require parametric assumptions and complicated calculations. In this article we develop a simple, yet powerful nonparametric method for choosing the number of clusters based on distortion, a quantity that measures the average distance, per dimension, between each observation and its closest cluster center. Our technique is computationally efficient and straightforward to implement. We demonstrate empirically its effectiveness, not only for choosing the number of clusters, but also for identifying underlying structure, on a wide range of simulated and real world datasets. In addition, we give a rigorous theoretical justification for the method based on information-theoretic ideas. Specifically, results from the subfield of electrical engineering known as rate distortion theory allow us to describe the behavior of the distortion in both the presence and absence of clustering. Finally, we note that these ideas potentially can be extended to a wide range of other statistical model selection problems.","['https://openalex.org/W2071306594', 'https://openalex.org/W4256276256', 'https://openalex.org/W4234300340', 'https://openalex.org/W2047555270', 'https://openalex.org/W2104930019', 'https://openalex.org/W2071949631', 'https://openalex.org/W1481566577', 'https://openalex.org/W1988997815', 'https://openalex.org/W1560089794', 'https://openalex.org/W2001619934', 'https://openalex.org/W1608472120', 'https://openalex.org/W2100736366', 'https://openalex.org/W2913066018', 'https://openalex.org/W2060442802', 'https://openalex.org/W4234966719', 'https://openalex.org/W2085487226', 'https://openalex.org/W1995945562', 'https://openalex.org/W1969557815', 'https://openalex.org/W1634005169', 'https://openalex.org/W2099111195', 'https://openalex.org/W1549664537', 'https://openalex.org/W2124670970', 'https://openalex.org/W2019359195', 'https://openalex.org/W2076580309', 'https://openalex.org/W4200406299', 'https://openalex.org/W2999729612', 'https://openalex.org/W2107903523', 'https://openalex.org/W1975152892', 'https://openalex.org/W2168175751', 'https://openalex.org/W1995875735', 'https://openalex.org/W2090215404', 'https://openalex.org/W2033235577', 'https://openalex.org/W2109820980', 'https://openalex.org/W2098113410', 'https://openalex.org/W2068632127', 'https://openalex.org/W2014078900', 'https://openalex.org/W2058815839', 'https://openalex.org/W2090658088', 'https://openalex.org/W2142901448', 'https://openalex.org/W1965555277']",2003-09-01

Most applications of variational inference employ simple families of posterior approximations in order to allow for efficient inference, focusing on mean-field or other simple structured approximations. This restriction has a significant impact on the quality of inferences made using variational methods. We introduce a new approach for specifying flexible, arbitrarily complex and scalable approximate posterior distributions. Our approximations are distributions constructed through a normalizing flow, whereby a simple initial density is transformed into a more complex one by applying a sequence of invertible transformations until a desired level of complexity is attained. We use this view of normalizing flows to develop categories of finite and infinitesimal flows and provide a unified view of approaches for constructing rich posterior approximations. We demonstrate that the theoretical advantages of having posteriors that better match the true posterior, combined with the scalability of amortized variational approaches, provides a clear improvement in performance and applicability of variational inference.","['https://openalex.org/W2137945003', 'https://openalex.org/W2122262818', 'https://openalex.org/W2962897886', 'https://openalex.org/W1555695166', 'https://openalex.org/W2170111110', 'https://openalex.org/W2403726878', 'https://openalex.org/W2104067967', 'https://openalex.org/W2098694378', 'https://openalex.org/W1534417711', 'https://openalex.org/W1516111018', 'https://openalex.org/W1506806321', 'https://openalex.org/W2167433878', 'https://openalex.org/W2963319345', 'https://openalex.org/W1959608418', 'https://openalex.org/W2166851633', 'https://openalex.org/W2146502635', 'https://openalex.org/W2161340280', 'https://openalex.org/W2963173382', 'https://openalex.org/W2949416428', 'https://openalex.org/W2150807068', 'https://openalex.org/W1729198099', 'https://openalex.org/W2119717200', 'https://openalex.org/W2099450296', 'https://openalex.org/W2478027467', 'https://openalex.org/W2108501770', 'https://openalex.org/W1583912456', 'https://openalex.org/W2120633557', 'https://openalex.org/W2070792261', 'https://openalex.org/W2097268041', 'https://openalex.org/W2480024362', 'https://openalex.org/W1906598733', 'https://openalex.org/W2164613257', 'https://openalex.org/W1663973292', 'https://openalex.org/W1494871301']",2015-05-21

Units (in the current work, phonemes) are selected to produce a natural realisation of a target phoneme sequence predicted from text which is annotated with prosodic and phonetic context information. We propose that the units in a synthesis database can be considered as a state transition network in which the state occupancy cost is the distance between a database unit and a target, and the transition cost is an estimate of the quality of concatenation of two consecutive units. This framework has many similarities to HMM-based speech recognition. A pruned Viterbi search is used to select the best units for synthesis from the database.

After introducing the field and its problems in general, this survey compares these generic systems according to a number of criteria such as the range of music theories these systems support.","['https://openalex.org/W206348627', 'https://openalex.org/W600103004', 'https://openalex.org/W2124716399', 'https://openalex.org/W2033074620', 'https://openalex.org/W1733489975', 'https://openalex.org/W2032041077', 'https://openalex.org/W2022236864', 'https://openalex.org/W2121623862', 'https://openalex.org/W1487478819', 'https://openalex.org/W1966902936', 'https://openalex.org/W2058150069', 'https://openalex.org/W1980754243', 'https://openalex.org/W4293282487', 'https://openalex.org/W2144805983', 'https://openalex.org/W1515441675', 'https://openalex.org/W4212899374', 'https://openalex.org/W1512123845', 'https://openalex.org/W2086267322', 'https://openalex.org/W1588134392', 'https://openalex.org/W2053117068', 'https://openalex.org/W1579516283', 'https://openalex.org/W1964007532', 'https://openalex.org/W6366331', 'https://openalex.org/W1480435719', 'https://openalex.org/W2039105019', 'https://openalex.org/W2153628411', 'https://openalex.org/W4390009472', 'https://openalex.org/W2795193196', 'https://openalex.org/W6676823770', 'https://openalex.org/W2141619189', 'https://openalex.org/W2127908756', 'https://openalex.org/W2035039580', 'https://openalex.org/W1994697606', 'https://openalex.org/W2079158925', 'https://openalex.org/W1503382435', 'https://openalex.org/W2321233547', 'https://openalex.org/W2156037025', 'https://openalex.org/W2010384749', 'https://openalex.org/W1496620702', 'https://openalex.org/W2944297474', 'https://openalex.org/W2143082793', 'https://openalex.org/W1601617333', 'https://openalex.org/W2396749677', 'https://openalex.org/W2115590028', 'https://openalex.org/W4238340159', 'https://openalex.org/W1495736750', 'https://openalex.org/W2734263782', 'https://openalex.org/W2166279570', 'https://openalex.org/W2911520123', 'https://openalex.org/W254944493', 'https://openalex.org/W4232557450', 'https://openalex.org/W1967934146', 'https://openalex.org/W74362393', 'https://openalex.org/W2400204790', 'https://openalex.org/W4285719527', 'https://openalex.org/W2174206963', 'https://openalex.org/W1989916294', 'https://openalex.org/W2329208473', 'https://openalex.org/W1507054833', 'https://openalex.org/W2341594233', 'https://openalex.org/W564992226', 'https://openalex.org/W772216571', 'https://openalex.org/W1580399267', 'https://openalex.org/W2023723978', 'https://openalex.org/W1586765942', 'https://openalex.org/W2132210624', 'https://openalex.org/W2620883451', 'https://openalex.org/W1556121947', 'https://openalex.org/W3131643527', 'https://openalex.org/W26772505', 'https://openalex.org/W1508272550', 'https://openalex.org/W47957325', 'https://openalex.org/W1524486391', 'https://openalex.org/W2167379809', 'https://openalex.org/W1880321215', 'https://openalex.org/W1517590008', 'https://openalex.org/W1568389378', 'https://openalex.org/W3142621357', 'https://openalex.org/W1652823179', 'https://openalex.org/W2185401186', 'https://openalex.org/W2089674328', 'https://openalex.org/W140304179', 'https://openalex.org/W1709565248', 'https://openalex.org/W2396300712', 'https://openalex.org/W1544328127', 'https://openalex.org/W2058296776', 'https://openalex.org/W1502799200', 'https://openalex.org/W2147486635', 'https://openalex.org/W185703229', 'https://openalex.org/W1485680143', 'https://openalex.org/W1576420969', 'https://openalex.org/W96340285', 'https://openalex.org/W1501121384', 'https://openalex.org/W616650091', 'https://openalex.org/W1505395785', 'https://openalex.org/W2061981200', 'https://openalex.org/W1860826869', 'https://openalex.org/W2110382134', 'https://openalex.org/W2112349754', 'https://openalex.org/W2339500526', 'https://openalex.org/W2403651582', 'https://openalex.org/W1990473760', 'https://openalex.org/W2114737695', 'https://openalex.org/W1988046102', 'https://openalex.org/W2724313895', 'https://openalex.org/W1513488242', 'https://openalex.org/W2337098149']",2011-10-01

The game of Dota 2 presents novel challenges for AI systems such as long time horizons, imperfect information, and complex, continuous state-action spaces, all challenges which will become increasingly central to more capable AI systems. OpenAI Five leveraged existing reinforcement learning techniques, scaled to learn from batches of approximately 2 million frames every 2 seconds. We developed a distributed training system and tools for continual training which allowed us to train OpenAI Five for 10 months.

Existing autoregressive models either suffer from excessively large computational resource requirements for high dimensional data, or make compromises in terms of distribution expressiveness or ease of implementation in order to decrease resource requirements. Our architecture, by contrast, maintains both full expressiveness over joint distributions over data and ease of implementation with standard deep learning frameworks, while requiring reasonable memory and computation and achieving state-of-the-art results on standard generative modeling benchmarks. Our models are based on axial attention, a simple generalization of self-attention that naturally aligns with the multiple dimensions of the tensors in both the encoding and the decoding settings. Notably the proposed structure of the layers allows for the vast majority of the context to be computed in parallel during decoding without introducing any independence assumptions. This semi-parallel structure goes a long way to making decoding from even a very large Axial Transformer broadly applicable. We demonstrate state-of-the-art results for the Axial Transformer on the ImageNet-32 and ImageNet-64 image benchmarks as well as on the BAIR Robotic Pushing video benchmark. We open source the implementation of Axial Transformers.","['https://openalex.org/W2963629403', 'https://openalex.org/W2413794162', 'https://openalex.org/W2423557781', 'https://openalex.org/W2963403868', 'https://openalex.org/W2948412951', 'https://openalex.org/W2950739196', 'https://openalex.org/W2962750131', 'https://openalex.org/W2940744433', 'https://openalex.org/W2964122153', 'https://openalex.org/W2962990490', 'https://openalex.org/W2963406904', 'https://openalex.org/W2267126114', 'https://openalex.org/W2981689412', 'https://openalex.org/W2918222882', 'https://openalex.org/W2963428348', 'https://openalex.org/W3005844337', 'https://openalex.org/W2950946978', 'https://openalex.org/W2097039814']",2019-12-20

Automatic lyrics transcription in polyphonic music is a challenging task because the singing vocals are corrupted by the background music. In this work, we propose to learn music genre-specific characteristics to train polyphonic acoustic models. For this purpose, we firstly study and compare several automatic speech recognition pipelines for the application of lyrics transcription. Later, we present the lyrics transcription performance of these music-informed acoustic models for the best-performing pipeline, and systematically study the impact of music genre and language model on the performance. With this genre-based approach, we explicitly model the characteristics of music, instead of trying to remove the background music as noise.

We propose a new type of normalizing flow, inverse autoregressive flow (IAF), that, in contrast to earlier published flows, scales well to high-dimensional latent spaces. The proposed flow consists of a chain of invertible transformations, where each transformation is based on an autoregressive neural network. In experiments, we show that IAF significantly improves upon diagonal Gaussian approximate posteriors. In addition, we demonstrate that a novel type of variational autoencoder, coupled with IAF, is competitive with neural autoregressive models in terms of attained log-likelihood on natural images, while allowing significantly faster synthesis.","['https://openalex.org/W2951493172', 'https://openalex.org/W1959608418', 'https://openalex.org/W2963685250', 'https://openalex.org/W2963147844', 'https://openalex.org/W1909320841', 'https://openalex.org/W2148464528', 'https://openalex.org/W2166851633', 'https://openalex.org/W581956982', 'https://openalex.org/W2194775991', 'https://openalex.org/W2293078015', 'https://openalex.org/W2101793402']",2016-01-01

Specifically, the three subnetworks generate bar profiles, beat profiles, and notes, in turn, and the output of the high-level subnetworks are fed into the low-level subnetworks, serving as guidance to generate the finer time-scale melody components in the low-level subnetworks.

However, existing representation learning methods generally rely on the autoregressive model and/or observed global dependencies while generating the representation. In this work, we propose Non-Autoregressive Predictive Coding (NPC), a self-supervised method, to learn a speech representation in a non-autoregressive manner by relying only on local dependencies of speech. NPC has a conceptually simple objective and can be implemented easily with the introduced Masked Convolution Blocks. NPC offers a significant speedup for inference since it is parallelizable in time and has a fixed inference time for each time step regardless of the input sequence length. We discuss and verify the effectiveness of NPC by theoretically and empirically comparing it with other methods. We show that the NPC representation is comparable to other methods in speech experiments on phonetic and speaker classification while being more efficient.","['https://openalex.org/W2842511635', 'https://openalex.org/W3097286738', 'https://openalex.org/W3035202887', 'https://openalex.org/W2982223350', 'https://openalex.org/W2973049979', 'https://openalex.org/W2962739339', 'https://openalex.org/W2972943112', 'https://openalex.org/W2950577311', 'https://openalex.org/W3003875258', 'https://openalex.org/W3125709657', 'https://openalex.org/W2963317665', 'https://openalex.org/W2996383576', 'https://openalex.org/W1494198834', 'https://openalex.org/W3015265920', 'https://openalex.org/W3016181583', 'https://openalex.org/W2963403868', 'https://openalex.org/W2981458636', 'https://openalex.org/W2964121744', 'https://openalex.org/W2973157397', 'https://openalex.org/W3096485810', 'https://openalex.org/W2970971581', 'https://openalex.org/W2963341956', 'https://openalex.org/W2963799213', 'https://openalex.org/W3099782249', 'https://openalex.org/W2024490156']",2021-08-27

The speech signals are transformed into a sequence of acoustic subword units or virtual phones which are discovered automatically from the given speech signals in an unsupervised manner. The speech signal is initially segmented into acoustically homogeneous segments through kernel-Gram segmentation using MFCC and autoencoder bottleneck features. These segments are then clustered using different clustering techniques. The cluster labels thus obtained are considered as virtual phone units which are used to transcribe the speech signals. The virtual phones for the utterances to be resynthesized are encoded as one-hot vector sequences. Deep neural network based duration model and acoustic model are trained for synthesis using these sequences. A vocoder is used to synthesize speech in target speaker's voice from the features estimated by the acoustic model. The performance evaluation is done on ZeroSpeech 2019 challenge on English and Indonesian language. The bitrate and speaker similarity were found to be better than the challenge baseline with slightly lower intelligibility due to the compact encoding.,"['https://openalex.org/W2786608204', 'https://openalex.org/W2346964103', 'https://openalex.org/W6697293080', 'https://openalex.org/W6675022971', 'https://openalex.org/W2347098582', 'https://openalex.org/W2745710152', 'https://openalex.org/W2345811097', 'https://openalex.org/W1967924372', 'https://openalex.org/W2052697931', 'https://openalex.org/W1796128977', 'https://openalex.org/W2020607164', 'https://openalex.org/W2826003142', 'https://openalex.org/W1510007267', 'https://openalex.org/W2134202996', 'https://openalex.org/W2962699523', 'https://openalex.org/W2964135678', 'https://openalex.org/W2532494225', 'https://openalex.org/W2963830550', 'https://openalex.org/W2902070858', 'https://openalex.org/W2747192917', 'https://openalex.org/W2803005441', 'https://openalex.org/W2890718354', 'https://openalex.org/W2598638573', 'https://openalex.org/W2059652594', 'https://openalex.org/W6680735885', 'https://openalex.org/W1975728937', 'https://openalex.org/W2964169922', 'https://openalex.org/W2471520273', 'https://openalex.org/W2940544976', 'https://openalex.org/W2057007397', 'https://openalex.org/W2398490608', 'https://openalex.org/W2407614114', 'https://openalex.org/W6631362777', 'https://openalex.org/W2774848319', 'https://openalex.org/W2973026522', 'https://openalex.org/W2963620343', 'https://openalex.org/W1524333225', 'https://openalex.org/W2165874743', 'https://openalex.org/W2141465109', 'https://openalex.org/W2100768664']",2019-11-01

A Survey of Four Emotions and Five Modalities Across 11 Cultures,"Abstract While much is known about how negative emotions are expressed in different modalities, our understanding of the nonverbal expressions of positive emotions remains limited. In the present research, we draw upon disparate lines of theoretical and empirical work on positive emotions, and systematically examine which channels are thought to be used for expressing four positive emotions: feeling moved, gratitude, interest, and triumph. Employing the intersubjective approach, an established method in cross-cultural psychology, we first explored how the four positive emotions were reported to be expressed in two North American community samples (Studies 1a and 1b: n = 1466). We next confirmed the cross-cultural generalizability of our findings by surveying respondents from ten countries that diverged on cultural values (Study 2: n = 1826). Feeling moved was thought to be signaled with facial expressions, gratitude with the use of words, interest with words, face and voice, and triumph with body posture, vocal cues, facial expressions, and words. These findings provide cross-culturally consistent findings of differential expressions across positive emotions. Notably, positive emotions were thought to be expressed via modalities that go beyond the face.","['https://openalex.org/W2103781831', 'https://openalex.org/W1977575297', 'https://openalex.org/W2127571795', 'https://openalex.org/W2163546575', 'https://openalex.org/W2076346682', 'https://openalex.org/W4245744384', 'https://openalex.org/W4253871341', 'https://openalex.org/W2113168798', 'https://openalex.org/W2081004291', 'https://openalex.org/W2123901740', 'https://openalex.org/W2114763674', 'https://openalex.org/W2979864122', 'https://openalex.org/W2756862522', 'https://openalex.org/W4252661582', 'https://openalex.org/W1971969367', 'https://openalex.org/W2626522798', 'https://openalex.org/W3190538731', 'https://openalex.org/W2950247511', 'https://openalex.org/W2905841571', 'https://openalex.org/W1604972595', 'https://openalex.org/W2085003717', 'https://openalex.org/W2034620660', 'https://openalex.org/W2074591627', 'https://openalex.org/W2738790848', 'https://openalex.org/W1966797434', 'https://openalex.org/W2022068631', 'https://openalex.org/W4236533540', 'https://openalex.org/W2168013334', 'https://openalex.org/W2071934951', 'https://openalex.org/W2072500831', 'https://openalex.org/W2770415942', 'https://openalex.org/W2804209642', 'https://openalex.org/W2007445014', 'https://openalex.org/W6638922503', 'https://openalex.org/W6852839900', 'https://openalex.org/W2789688997', 'https://openalex.org/W2804436848', 'https://openalex.org/W2089358714', 'https://openalex.org/W2152966241', 'https://openalex.org/W4399578533', 'https://openalex.org/W2316342334', 'https://openalex.org/W2401780381', 'https://openalex.org/W2114856148', 'https://openalex.org/W2163429658', 'https://openalex.org/W2917415925', 'https://openalex.org/W2164471543', 'https://openalex.org/W2112376540', 'https://openalex.org/W2150403218', 'https://openalex.org/W2996641430', 'https://openalex.org/W6640387931', 'https://openalex.org/W2045154139', 'https://openalex.org/W2588736771', 'https://openalex.org/W2067425942', 'https://openalex.org/W4248591389', 'https://openalex.org/W4230001657', 'https://openalex.org/W2045826950', 'https://openalex.org/W2114959145', 'https://openalex.org/W2140782513', 'https://openalex.org/W633327578', 'https://openalex.org/W2085099526', 'https://openalex.org/W2593392694', 'https://openalex.org/W2167621245', 'https://openalex.org/W2095829101', 'https://openalex.org/W2137412454', 'https://openalex.org/W2582743722', 'https://openalex.org/W2001815708', 'https://openalex.org/W2154480377', 'https://openalex.org/W2042863830', 'https://openalex.org/W1993363516', 'https://openalex.org/W1975238145', 'https://openalex.org/W2626982410', 'https://openalex.org/W2048765566', 'https://openalex.org/W2117237841', 'https://openalex.org/W2583542555', 'https://openalex.org/W2562161918', 'https://openalex.org/W3014201970', 'https://openalex.org/W2153900863', 'https://openalex.org/W2776575342', 'https://openalex.org/W2086814126', 'https://openalex.org/W4256441345', 'https://openalex.org/W1570597587', 'https://openalex.org/W2761122192', 'https://openalex.org/W2033428167', 'https://openalex.org/W2117651526', 'https://openalex.org/W2166118664', 'https://openalex.org/W2119318965', 'https://openalex.org/W1543806480', 'https://openalex.org/W2061213600', 'https://openalex.org/W2947915034', 'https://openalex.org/W2121247252', 'https://openalex.org/W1987937487', 'https://openalex.org/W2132673112', 'https://openalex.org/W2155144982', 'https://openalex.org/W2141960018', 'https://openalex.org/W2141093480', 'https://openalex.org/W2805967452', 'https://openalex.org/W601008645', 'https://openalex.org/W2113884929', 'https://openalex.org/W2601891535', 'https://openalex.org/W2079177735', 'https://openalex.org/W2586296314', 'https://openalex.org/W2607784970', 'https://openalex.org/W2315689228', 'https://openalex.org/W2072038603', 'https://openalex.org/W2260186468', 'https://openalex.org/W2169124432', 'https://openalex.org/W2596405528', 'https://openalex.org/W3048784195', 'https://openalex.org/W2802400506', 'https://openalex.org/W2911404604', 'https://openalex.org/W4367314869', 'https://openalex.org/W2157134953', 'https://openalex.org/W4200005433', 'https://openalex.org/W3012004216', 'https://openalex.org/W2737934660', 'https://openalex.org/W2118789253', 'https://openalex.org/W2044950274', 'https://openalex.org/W2019312772', 'https://openalex.org/W1937226553', 'https://openalex.org/W3128629234', 'https://openalex.org/W1588539311', 'https://openalex.org/W2145337957', 'https://openalex.org/W1850070871', 'https://openalex.org/W2006044072', 'https://openalex.org/W2156948210']",2021-07-22

The encoder constructs a latent embedding of the fundamental frequency (F0) contour and the spectrum, which we regularize using the Large Diffeomorphic Metric Mapping (LDDMM) registration framework. The decoder uses this embedding to predict the modified F0 contour in a target emotional class. Finally, the predictor uses the original spectrum and the modified F0 contour to generate a corresponding target spectrum. Our joint objective function simultaneously optimizes the parameters of three model blocks. We show that our method outperforms the existing state-of-the-art approaches on both, the saliency of emotion conversion and the quality of resynthesized speech. In addition, the LDDMM regularization allows our model to convert phrases that were not present in training, thus providing evidence for out-of-sample generalization.","['https://openalex.org/W2972334330', 'https://openalex.org/W2471520273', 'https://openalex.org/W112588824', 'https://openalex.org/W2115167851', 'https://openalex.org/W2517513811', 'https://openalex.org/W2962793481', 'https://openalex.org/W95152782', 'https://openalex.org/W586270867', 'https://openalex.org/W2963684088', 'https://openalex.org/W2049686551', 'https://openalex.org/W1976725440', 'https://openalex.org/W2964121744', 'https://openalex.org/W2976159681', 'https://openalex.org/W2963091184', 'https://openalex.org/W2774848319', 'https://openalex.org/W2972366998', 'https://openalex.org/W2964243274', 'https://openalex.org/W2786270934', 'https://openalex.org/W2170167891', 'https://openalex.org/W3004402693', 'https://openalex.org/W2981934523', 'https://openalex.org/W2519091744', 'https://openalex.org/W2766406951', 'https://openalex.org/W2077801020', 'https://openalex.org/W2948238043', 'https://openalex.org/W2973138167', 'https://openalex.org/W2006302620']",2020-10-25

In this chapter, we will focus mostly on the technical side. From the recording of expressive speech to its modeling, the reader will have an overview of the main paradigms used in this field, through some of the most prominent systems and methods. We explain how speech can be represented and encoded with audio features. We present a history of the main methods of Text-to-Speech synthesis: concatenative, parametric and statistical parametric speech synthesis.

Previous approaches mainly focused on modeling one-to-one mapping, i.e., conversion from one emotional state to another emotional state, with Mel-cepstral vocoders. In this paper, we investigate building a multi-target EVC (MTEVC) architecture, which combines a deep bidirectional long-short term memory (DBLSTM)-based conversion model and a neural vocoder. Phonetic posteriorgrams (PPGs) containing rich linguistic information are incorporated into the conversion model as auxiliary input features, which boost the conversion performance. To leverage the advantages of the newly emerged neural vocoders, we investigate the conditional WaveNet and flow-based WaveNet (FloWaveNet) as speech generators. The vocoders take in additional speaker information and emotion information as auxiliary features and are trained with a multi-speaker and multi-emotion speech corpus. Objective metrics and subjective evaluation of the experimental results verify the efficacy of the proposed MTEVC architecture for EVC.","['https://openalex.org/W2161736993', 'https://openalex.org/W2963300588', 'https://openalex.org/W2964243274', 'https://openalex.org/W2973108288', 'https://openalex.org/W2120847449', 'https://openalex.org/W2109938215', 'https://openalex.org/W2517513811', 'https://openalex.org/W2963139417', 'https://openalex.org/W2889092828', 'https://openalex.org/W2802968248', 'https://openalex.org/W2793479148', 'https://openalex.org/W2471520273', 'https://openalex.org/W2526785520', 'https://openalex.org/W113106864', 'https://openalex.org/W2158504378', 'https://openalex.org/W2409550820', 'https://openalex.org/W2805038428', 'https://openalex.org/W2039800941', 'https://openalex.org/W3044514286', 'https://openalex.org/W2749651610', 'https://openalex.org/W2795109282', 'https://openalex.org/W2899882692', 'https://openalex.org/W2794490148', 'https://openalex.org/W2518172956', 'https://openalex.org/W2748654097', 'https://openalex.org/W2888922217', 'https://openalex.org/W2519091744', 'https://openalex.org/W2049686551', 'https://openalex.org/W3127686677', 'https://openalex.org/W3099078140', 'https://openalex.org/W2745595539', 'https://openalex.org/W2185573909', 'https://openalex.org/W226412370', 'https://openalex.org/W2162295204']",2020-04-08

In recent years, speech recognition and synthesis techniques have been developed, and an emotional voice conversion technique is required for synthesizing more expressive voices. The common emotional conversion was based on transformation of neutral prosody to emotional prosody by using huge speech corpus. In this paper, we convert a neutral voice to an emotional voice using GMMs. GMM-based spectrum conversion is widely used to modify non linguistic information such as voice characteristics while keeping linguistic information unchanged. Because the conventional method converts either prosody or voice quality (spectrum), some emotions are not converted well. In our method, both prosody and voice quality are used for converting a neutral voice to an emotional voice, and it is able to obtain more expressive voices in comparison with conventional methods, such as prosody or spectrum conversion.","['https://openalex.org/W2129343891', 'https://openalex.org/W1558063916', 'https://openalex.org/W1530874618', 'https://openalex.org/W2007023536', 'https://openalex.org/W2152205330', 'https://openalex.org/W23142961', 'https://openalex.org/W198589515', 'https://openalex.org/W2162295204', 'https://openalex.org/W43755971', 'https://openalex.org/W2164241094', 'https://openalex.org/W2407110532', 'https://openalex.org/W2395052932', 'https://openalex.org/W2120605154', 'https://openalex.org/W2026575276', 'https://openalex.org/W1495108311']",2012-12-01

Previous state-of-the-art technology used in VC was based on the sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) model, which could lose linguistic information. There was an attempt to overcome this problem using textual supervision; however, this required explicit alignment, and therefore the benefit of using seq2seq model was lost. In this study, a voice converter that utilizes multitask learning with text-to-speech (TTS) is presented. By using multitask learning, VC is expected to capture linguistic information and preserve the training stability. This method does not require explicit alignment for capturing abundant text information. Experiments on VC were performed on a male-Korean-emotional-text-speech dataset to convert the neutral voice to emotional voice. It was shown that multitask learning helps to preserve the linguistic content.","['https://openalex.org/W6754925833', 'https://openalex.org/W2740504963', 'https://openalex.org/W2950542544', 'https://openalex.org/W2883743124', 'https://openalex.org/W6762492278', 'https://openalex.org/W2888922217', 'https://openalex.org/W2795109282', 'https://openalex.org/W6746238782', 'https://openalex.org/W2010910318', 'https://openalex.org/W186286710', 'https://openalex.org/W1509691205', 'https://openalex.org/W2157412983', 'https://openalex.org/W2897353073', 'https://openalex.org/W6679434410', 'https://openalex.org/W6736996214', 'https://openalex.org/W2901254300', 'https://openalex.org/W2120605154', 'https://openalex.org/W2013996527', 'https://openalex.org/W2964243274', 'https://openalex.org/W2911929781', 'https://openalex.org/W2964308564', 'https://openalex.org/W3099078140', 'https://openalex.org/W4295731579', 'https://openalex.org/W2963927338', 'https://openalex.org/W2770743791', 'https://openalex.org/W2963609956', 'https://openalex.org/W2892140764', 'https://openalex.org/W3102905810', 'https://openalex.org/W2133564696', 'https://openalex.org/W2944711403']",2020-04-09

The kernel method for this algorithm is the ""NCCF or Normalized Cross Correlation"" reported by David Talkin [1]. Major innovations include: processing of the original acoustic signal and a nonlinearly processed version of the signal to partially restore very weak F0 components; intelligent peak picking to select multiple F0 candidates and assign merit factors; and, incorporation of highly rohust pitch contours obtained from smoothed versions of low frequency portions of spectrograms. Dynamic programming is used to find the ""best"" pitch track among all the candidates, using both local and transition costs. We evaluated our algorithm using the Keele pitch extraction reference database as ""ground truth"" for both ""high quality"" and ""telephone"" speech.

Current text-to-speech methods produce realistic sounding voices, but they lack the emotional expressivity that listeners expect, given the context of the interaction and the phrase being spoken. Emotional voice conversion is a research domain concerned with generating expressive speech from neutral synthesised speech or natural human voice. This research investigated the effectiveness of using a sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) encoder-decoder based model to transform the intonation of a human voice from neutral to expressive speech, with some preliminary introduction of linguistic conditioning. A subjective experiment conducted on the task of speech emotion recognition by listeners successfully demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed sequence-to-sequence models to produce convincing voice emotion transformations. In particular, conditioning the model on the position of the syllable in the phrase significantly improved recognition rates.","['https://openalex.org/W6602504493', 'https://openalex.org/W6713858911', 'https://openalex.org/W2184310502', 'https://openalex.org/W6751998403', 'https://openalex.org/W6696843773', 'https://openalex.org/W1576227399', 'https://openalex.org/W2517513811', 'https://openalex.org/W2613654124', 'https://openalex.org/W2747914378', 'https://openalex.org/W2513051195', 'https://openalex.org/W6600618385', 'https://openalex.org/W2808514527', 'https://openalex.org/W2746192915', 'https://openalex.org/W2106421426', 'https://openalex.org/W2740504963', 'https://openalex.org/W2886195082', 'https://openalex.org/W6604530167', 'https://openalex.org/W3142087749', 'https://openalex.org/W1570629387', 'https://openalex.org/W6683488333', 'https://openalex.org/W2018338387', 'https://openalex.org/W6679436768', 'https://openalex.org/W6736356763', 'https://openalex.org/W2157331557', 'https://openalex.org/W6679434410', 'https://openalex.org/W2964308564', 'https://openalex.org/W2949382160', 'https://openalex.org/W15106243', 'https://openalex.org/W2407110532', 'https://openalex.org/W2604184139', 'https://openalex.org/W2133564696', 'https://openalex.org/W2805307277', 'https://openalex.org/W2605141709', 'https://openalex.org/W113106864', 'https://openalex.org/W2294797155', 'https://openalex.org/W2130942839', 'https://openalex.org/W63438600', 'https://openalex.org/W2158504378', 'https://openalex.org/W2519091744', 'https://openalex.org/W2674088828']",2019-04-17

Speech analysis, manipulation, and synthesis on the basis of vocoders are used in various kinds of speech research. Although several high-quality speech synthesis systems have been developed, real-time processing has been difficult with them because of their high computational costs. This new speech synthesis system has not only sound quality but also quick processing. It consists of three analysis algorithms and one synthesis algorithm proposed in our previous research. The effectiveness of the system was evaluated by comparing its output with against natural speech including consonants. Its processing speed was also compared with those of conventional systems. The results showed that WORLD was superior to the other systems in terms of both sound quality and processing speed. In particular, it was over ten times faster than the conventional systems, and the real time factor (RTF) indicated that it was fast enough for real-time processing.","['https://openalex.org/W2142747467', 'https://openalex.org/W2082321072', 'https://openalex.org/W4245284779', 'https://openalex.org/W1572730534', 'https://openalex.org/W2049686551', 'https://openalex.org/W4235716345', 'https://openalex.org/W2428180336', 'https://openalex.org/W2164764235', 'https://openalex.org/W125998882', 'https://openalex.org/W2077446647', 'https://openalex.org/W2130081501', 'https://openalex.org/W2131062138', 'https://openalex.org/W2030351702', 'https://openalex.org/W1563089615', 'https://openalex.org/W2012086895', 'https://openalex.org/W2094130157', 'https://openalex.org/W773905565', 'https://openalex.org/W86348706', 'https://openalex.org/W2064948657', 'https://openalex.org/W2091425152', 'https://openalex.org/W1975079546', 'https://openalex.org/W2097645910', 'https://openalex.org/W2579537926', 'https://openalex.org/W2018458134', 'https://openalex.org/W2109189270', 'https://openalex.org/W1498609987', 'https://openalex.org/W2052002522', 'https://openalex.org/W2404204166', 'https://openalex.org/W1926768285', 'https://openalex.org/W198589515', 'https://openalex.org/W2032030908', 'https://openalex.org/W2150619194', 'https://openalex.org/W1563460361', 'https://openalex.org/W2122627441', 'https://openalex.org/W2129142580', 'https://openalex.org/W2556247670']",2016-01-01

To control speaking styles, existing expressive TTS models use categorical style index or reference speech as style input. In this work, we propose StyleTagging-TTS (ST-TTS), a novel expressive TTS model that utilizes a style tag written in natural language. Using a style-tagged TTS dataset and a pre-trained language model, we modeled the relationship between linguistic embedding and speaking style domain, which enables our model to work even with style tags unseen during training. As style tag is written in natural language, it can control speaking style in a more intuitive, interpretable, and scalable way compared with style index or reference speech. In addition, in terms of model architecture, we propose an efficient non-autoregressive (NAR) TTS architecture with single-stage training. The experimental result shows that ST-TTS outperforms the existing expressive TTS model, Tacotron2-GST in speech quality and expressiveness.","['https://openalex.org/W1522301498', 'https://openalex.org/W2964243274', 'https://openalex.org/W2963927338', 'https://openalex.org/W2187089797', 'https://openalex.org/W2946200149', 'https://openalex.org/W2969658393', 'https://openalex.org/W2963272440', 'https://openalex.org/W3048173247', 'https://openalex.org/W2409550820', 'https://openalex.org/W2963341956', 'https://openalex.org/W2903739847', 'https://openalex.org/W2808706139', 'https://openalex.org/W2971193649', 'https://openalex.org/W2770743791', 'https://openalex.org/W2963139417', 'https://openalex.org/W1836465849', 'https://openalex.org/W3092028330', 'https://openalex.org/W3033913438', 'https://openalex.org/W3026874504', 'https://openalex.org/W2767052532', 'https://openalex.org/W2963685250', 'https://openalex.org/W2626778328', 'https://openalex.org/W2972699445', 'https://openalex.org/W3015338123', 'https://openalex.org/W2046033161', 'https://openalex.org/W3095695385', 'https://openalex.org/W2803193013', 'https://openalex.org/W3130016944', 'https://openalex.org/W2810914326']",2021-04-01

Therefore, it is fundamental to translate them into a\nwidely spoken language to ensure interpretability of the recordings. In this\npaper we investigate how the choice of translation language affects the\nposterior documentation work and potential automatic approaches which will work\non top of the produced bilingual corpus. For answering this question, we use\nthe MaSS multilingual speech corpus (Boito et al., 2020) for creating 56\nbilingual pairs that we apply to the task of low-resource unsupervised word\nsegmentation and alignment. Our results highlight that the choice of language\nfor translation influences the word segmentation performance, and that\ndifferent lexicons are learned by using different aligned translations. Lastly,\nthis paper proposes a hybrid approach for bilingual word segmentation,\ncombining boundary clues extracted from a non-parametric Bayesian model\n(Goldwater et al., 2009a) with the attentional word segmentation neural model\nfrom Godard et al. (2018). Our results suggest that incorporating these clues\ninto the neural models' input representation increases their translation and\nalignment quality, specially for challenging language pairs.\n","['https://openalex.org/W240478693', 'https://openalex.org/W2883972335', 'https://openalex.org/W3032598645', 'https://openalex.org/W2955019563', 'https://openalex.org/W2586602577', 'https://openalex.org/W2762715843', 'https://openalex.org/W2964308564', 'https://openalex.org/W2038542953', 'https://openalex.org/W175497273', 'https://openalex.org/W2111668269', 'https://openalex.org/W2126449874', 'https://openalex.org/W2126377586', 'https://openalex.org/W2586232309', 'https://openalex.org/W2884066185', 'https://openalex.org/W2173413395', 'https://openalex.org/W2895097770', 'https://openalex.org/W2515167330', 'https://openalex.org/W2582956876', 'https://openalex.org/W1557247526', 'https://openalex.org/W2808682925', 'https://openalex.org/W2122228338', 'https://openalex.org/W2101281673', 'https://openalex.org/W2963378435', 'https://openalex.org/W2963819008', 'https://openalex.org/W2101105183', 'https://openalex.org/W2980433540', 'https://openalex.org/W2466918907']",2020-03-30

This paper describes the development of ELPIS, a pipeline which language documentation workers with minimal computational experience can use to build their own speech recognition models, resulting in models being built for 16 languages from the Asia-Pacific region. ELPIS puts machine learning speech technologies within reach of people working with languages with scarce data, in a scalable way. This is impactful since it enables language communities to cross the digital divide, and speeds up language documentation. Complete automation of the process is not feasible for languages with small quantities of data and potentially large vocabularies. Hence our goal is not full automation, but rather to make a practical and effective workflow that integrates machine learning technologies.","['https://openalex.org/W1875231349', 'https://openalex.org/W2288974476', 'https://openalex.org/W1573465296', 'https://openalex.org/W2895097770', 'https://openalex.org/W2897388834', 'https://openalex.org/W1524333225', 'https://openalex.org/W2735115738', 'https://openalex.org/W763498075', 'https://openalex.org/W2803214681', 'https://openalex.org/W2953320089']",2018-08-29

While the solution space for the task is far from fully explored, the dominant approach to date decomposes the discovery problem into two steps, where (i) segmental dynamic time warping is used to search the speech audio for repeated acoustic patterns, and (ii) these individual repetitions are partitioned into word/phrase categories using graph clustering. In this paper, we perform an unprecedented evaluation of a wide range of advanced graph clustering methods for the UTD task. We conduct our study in the evaluation framework of the Zero Resource Speech Challenge. We find that, for a range of features and languages, modularity-based clustering improves UTD performance most consistently, often by a wide margin. When paired with out-of-language deep neural net bottleneck features, we find performance near that of a high-resource UTD system.","['https://openalex.org/W66167291', 'https://openalex.org/W2164998314', 'https://openalex.org/W2047940964', 'https://openalex.org/W2059652594', 'https://openalex.org/W2060108852', 'https://openalex.org/W2025482506', 'https://openalex.org/W2151936673', 'https://openalex.org/W2168080440', 'https://openalex.org/W2786608204', 'https://openalex.org/W2052697931', 'https://openalex.org/W1539935047', 'https://openalex.org/W1991274470', 'https://openalex.org/W2132202037', 'https://openalex.org/W2089458547', 'https://openalex.org/W1967924372', 'https://openalex.org/W1580203226', 'https://openalex.org/W1545920196', 'https://openalex.org/W2036964623', 'https://openalex.org/W2072396742', 'https://openalex.org/W1983345514', 'https://openalex.org/W2018562712', 'https://openalex.org/W2401464865', 'https://openalex.org/W2124209874', 'https://openalex.org/W2062914951', 'https://openalex.org/W2294799344', 'https://openalex.org/W2131681506', 'https://openalex.org/W2057007397', 'https://openalex.org/W30845872', 'https://openalex.org/W229097380', 'https://openalex.org/W2078769636', 'https://openalex.org/W2109726592', 'https://openalex.org/W2114347655', 'https://openalex.org/W2095293504']",2015-09-06
https://openalex.org/W2111668269,,Nonparametric bayesian models of lexical acquisition,"The child learning language is faced with a daunting task: to learn to extract meaning from an apparently meaningless stream of sound. This thesis rests on the assumption that the kinds of generalizations the learner may make are constrained by the interaction of many different types of stochastic information, including innate learning biases. I use computational modeling to investigate how the generalizations made by unsupervised learners are affected by the sources of information available to them. I adopt a Bayesian perspective, where both internal representations of language and any learning biases are made explicit. 
I begin by presenting a generic framework for language modeling based on nonparametric Bayesian statistics, where model complexity grows with the amount of input data. This framework divides the work of modeling between a generator, which generates lexical items, and an adaptor, which generates frequencies for those items. Separating the two tasks in this way makes the framework flexible, allowing individual components to be easily modified. Standard sampling methods, such as Gibbs or Metropolis-Hastings sampling, may be used for inference. 
Using this framework, I develop several specific models to investigate questions related to morphological acquisition (identifying stems and suffixes) and word segmentation (identifying word boundaries in phonemically transcribed speech). I apply these models to English corpora of newspaper text and phonemically transcribed child-directed speech. With regard to morphology, my experiments provide evidence that morphological information is learned better from word types than from word tokens. With regard to word segmentation, my results indicate that assuming independence between words (as many previous models have done) leads to undersegmentation of the data. Accounting for local context improves segmentation markedly and yields better results than previous models. 
I conclude by describing briefly how the models presented here can be extended in order to account for a wider range of linguistic phenomena, including phonetic variability and the relationship between morphology and syntactic class.","['https://openalex.org/W1971245457', 'https://openalex.org/W2952343510', 'https://openalex.org/W2070586582', 'https://openalex.org/W1586407478',

https://openalex.org/W2963819008,,Unwritten Languages Demand Attention Too! Word Discovery with Encoder-Decoder Models,"Word discovery is the task of extracting words from un-segmented text. In this paper we examine to what extent neu-ral networks can be applied to this task in a realistic unwritten language scenario, where only small corpora and limited annotations are available. We investigate two scenarios: one with no supervision and another with limited supervision with access to the most frequent words. Obtained results show that it is possible to retrieve at least 27% of the gold standard vocabulary by training an encoder-decoder neural machine translation system with only 5,157 sentences.

https://openalex.org/W2985777044,,Unsupervised word discovery for computational language documentation,"Language diversity is under considerable pressure: half of the world’s languages could disappear by the end of this century. This realization has sparked many initiatives in documentary linguistics in the past two decades, and 2019 has been proclaimed the International Year of Indigenous Languages by the United Nations, to raise public awareness of the issue and foster initiatives for language documentation and preservation. Yet documentation and preservation are time-consuming processes, and the supply of field linguists is limited. Consequently, the emerging field of computational language documentation (CLD) seeks to assist linguists in providing them with automatic processing tools. The Breaking the Unwritten Language Barrier (BULB) project, for instance, constitutes one of the efforts defining this new field, bringing together linguists and computer scientists. This thesis examines the particular problem of discovering words in an unsegmented stream of characters, or phonemes, transcribed from speech in a very-low-resource setting. This primarily involves a segmentation procedure, which can also be paired with an alignment procedure when a translation is available. Using two realistic Bantu corpora for language documentation, one in Mboshi (Republic of the Congo) and the other in Myene (Gabon), we benchmark various monolingual and bilingual unsupervised word discovery methods. We then show that using expert knowledge in the Adaptor Grammar framework can vastly improve segmentation results, and we indicate ways to use this framework as a decision tool for the linguist. We also propose a tonal variant for a strong nonparametric Bayesian segmentation algorithm, making use of a modified backoff scheme designed to capture tonal structure. To leverage the weak supervision given by a translation, we finally propose and extend an attention-based neural segmentation method, improving significantly the segmentation performance of an existing bilingual method.",[],2019-04-16
https://openalex.org/W2173413395,,Untrained Forced Alignment of Transcriptions and Audio for Language Documentation Corpora using WebMAUS,"Language documentation projects supported by recent funding intiatives have created a large number of multimedia corpora of typologically diverse languages. Most of these corpora provide a manual alignment of transcription and audio data at the level of larger units, such as sentences or intonation units. Their usefulness both for corpus-linguistic and psycholinguistic research and for the development of tools and teaching materials could, however, be increased by achieving a more fine-grained alignment of transcription and audio at the word or even phoneme level. Since most language documentation corpora contain data on small languages, there usually do not exist any speech recognizers or acoustic models specifically trained on these languages. We therefore investigate the feasibility of untrained forced alignment for such corpora. We report on an evaluation of the tool (Web)MAUS (Kisler et al., 2012) on several language documentation corpora and discuss practical issues in the application of forced alignment. Our evaluation shows that (Web)MAUS with its existing acoustic models combined with simple grapheme-to-phoneme conversion can be successfully used for word-level forced alignment of a diverse set of languages without additional training, especially if a manual prealignment of larger annotation units is already avaible.","['https://openalex.org/W267812377', 'https://openalex.org/W1503183868', 'https://openalex.org/W2040437955', 'https://openalex.org/W1952705488', 'https://openalex.org/W1871004397', 'https://openalex.org/W1845911164', 'https://openalex.org/W1593934207', 'https://openalex.org/W2278187120', 'https://openalex.org/W2557460871', 'https://openalex.org/W2014840417', 'https://openalex.org/W1718330812', 'https://openalex.org/W1963727751']",2014-05-01

This article reports on a success story in integrating automatic transcription into the language documentation workflow, specifically for Yongning Na, a language of Southwest China. Using Persephone, an open-source toolkit, a single-speaker speech transcription tool was trained over five hours of manually transcribed speech. The experiments found that this method can achieve a remarkably low error rate (on the order of 17%), and that automatic transcriptions were useful as a canvas for the linguist. The present report is intended for linguists with little or no knowledge of speech processing. It aims to provide insights into (i) the way the tool operates and (ii) the process of collaborating with natural language processing specialists.

However, for a task like speech to speech translation, the written form of a language may be considered as secondary and it might be possible, under certain conditions, to bypass it. This paper is our first attempt to show that such an approach is possible. We propose a phone-based speech translation approach where translation models are learned on a parallel corpus made of foreign phone sequences and their corresponding English translation. Our experiments show that using our so-called phone-based approach leads almost to the same performance as the baseline approach, while being theoretically applicable to any non written language.","['https://openalex.org/W4237938692', 'https://openalex.org/W2165095312', 'https://openalex.org/W2101711363', 'https://openalex.org/W6600595526', 'https://openalex.org/W2074546930', 'https://openalex.org/W3149335959', 'https://openalex.org/W2038395276', 'https://openalex.org/W6642785364', 'https://openalex.org/W4388277788', 'https://openalex.org/W4251556668', 'https://openalex.org/W2070554026', 'https://openalex.org/W14331692', 'https://openalex.org/W60702959', 'https://openalex.org/W2952343510', 'https://openalex.org/W4297941907', 'https://openalex.org/W2150907703', 'https://openalex.org/W3036063182', 'https://openalex.org/W1970887833', 'https://openalex.org/W2107917162', 'https://openalex.org/W1984672765']",2006-01-01

The basic annotation of speech data usually consists of time-aligned orthographic transcriptions. To answer phonetic or phonological research questions, phonetic transcriptions are needed as well. However, manual annotation is very time-consuming and requires considerable skill and near-native competence. Therefore it can take years of speech corpus compilation and annotation before any analyses can be carried out. In this paper, approaches that address the transcription bottleneck of speech corpus exploitation are presented and discussed, including crowdsourcing the orthographic transcription, automatic phonetic alignment, and query-driven annotation. Currently, query-driven annotation and automatic phonetic alignment are being combined and applied in two speech research projects at the Institut fur Deutsche Sprache (IDS), whereas crowdsourcing the orthographic transcription still awaits implementation.","['https://openalex.org/W1718330812', 'https://openalex.org/W2572080576', 'https://openalex.org/W1492549949', 'https://openalex.org/W2160196178', 'https://openalex.org/W3216401400', 'https://openalex.org/W2617294414', 'https://openalex.org/W2053486405', 'https://openalex.org/W2022710553', 'https://openalex.org/W1746880588', 'https://openalex.org/W2155576284', 'https://openalex.org/W2141282920', 'https://openalex.org/W132534168']",2008-01-01

We extend the recent MusicVAE model to represent multitrack polyphonic measures as vectors in a latent space. Our approach enables several useful operations such as generating plausible measures from scratch, interpolating between measures in a musically meaningful way, and manipulating specific musical attributes. We also introduce chord conditioning, which allows all of these operations to be performed while keeping harmony fixed, and allows chords to be changed while maintaining musical ""style"". By generating a sequence of measures over a predefined chord progression, our model can produce music with convincing long-term structure.

Music, and drumming in particular, provides a strong test case for this approach because many common transformations (quantization, removing voices) have clear semantics, and models for learning to invert them have real-world applications. Focusing on the case of drum set players, we create and release a new dataset for this purpose, containing over 13 hours of recordings by professional drummers aligned with fine-grained timing and dynamics information. We also explore some of the creative potential of these models, including demonstrating improvements on state-of-the-art methods for Humanization (instantiating a performance from a musical score).",[],2019-05-14
https://openalex.org/W2475687244,https://doi.org/10.7916/d8n58mhv,"Learning-Based Methods for Comparing Sequences, with Applications to Audio-to-MIDI Alignment and Matching","Sequences of feature vectors are a natural way of representing temporal data. Given a database of sequences, a fundamental task is to find the database entry which is the most similar to a query. In this thesis, we present learning-based methods for efficiently and accurately comparing sequences in order to facilitate large-scale sequence search. Throughout, we will focus on the problem of matching MIDI files (a digital score format) to a large collection of audio recordings of music. The combination of our proposed approaches enables us to create the largest corpus of paired MIDI files and audio recordings ever assembled. Dynamic time warping (DTW) has proven to be an extremely effective method for both aligning and matching sequences. However, its performance is heavily affected by factors such as the feature representation used and its adjustable parameters. We therefore investigate automatically optimizing DTW-based alignment and matching of MIDI and audio data. Our approach uses Bayesian optimization to tune system design and parameters over a synthetically-created dataset of audio and MIDI pairs. We then perform an exhaustive search over DTW score normalization techniques to find the optimal method for reporting a reliable alignment confidence score, as required in matching tasks. This results in a DTW-based system which is conceptually simple and highly accurate at both alignment and matching. We also verify that this system achieves high performance in a large-scale qualitative evaluation of real-world alignments. Unfortunately, DTW can be far too inefficient for large-scale search when sequences are very long and consist of high-dimensional feature vectors. We therefore propose a method for mapping sequences of continuously-valued feature vectors to downsampled sequences of binary vectors. Our approach involves training a pair of convolutional networks to map paired groups of subsequent feature vectors to a Hamming space where similarity is preserved. Evaluated on the task of matching MIDI files to a large database of audio recordings, we show that this technique enables 99.99\% of the database to be discarded with a modest false reject rate while only requiring 0.2\% of the time to compute. Even when sped-up with a more efficient representation, the quadratic complexity of DTW greatly hinders its feasibility for very large-scale search. This cost can be avoided by mapping entire sequences to fixed-length vectors in an embedded space where sequence similarity is approximated by Euclidean distance. To achieve this embedding, we propose a feed-forward attention-based neural network model which can integrate arbitrarily long sequences. We show that this approach can extremely efficiently prune 90\% of our audio recording database with high confidence. After developing these approaches, we applied them together to the practical task of matching 178,561 unique MIDI files to the Million Song Dataset. The resulting ``Lakh MIDI Dataset'' provides a potential bounty of ground truth information for audio content-based music information retrieval. This can include transcription, meter, lyrics, and high-level musicological features. The reliability of the resulting annotations depends both on the quality of the transcription and the accuracy of the score-to-audio alignment. We therefore establish a baseline of reliability for score-derived information for different content-based MIR tasks. Finally, we discuss potential future uses of our dataset and the learning-based sequence comparison methods we developed.","['https://openalex.org/W2403342846', 'https://openalex.org/W584173323', 'https://openalex.org/W1980497326', 'https://openalex.org/W2404620398', 'https://openalex.org/W2221409856', 'https://openalex.org/W2107878631', 'https://openalex.org/W2094728533', 'https://openalex.org/W2147800946', 'https://openalex.org/W2153579005', 'https://openalex.org/W2155273149', 'https://openalex.org/W2398243923']",2016-01-01

Developing better feature-space representations has been predominantly employed to reduce complexity, e.g., by eliminating non-helpful feature attributes from the input space prior to (or during) training. This is an important task, since many multi-label methods typically create many different copies or views of the same input data as they transform it, and considerable memory can be saved by taking advantage of redundancy.
