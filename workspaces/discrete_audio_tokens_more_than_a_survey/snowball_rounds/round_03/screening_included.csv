Training leverages recent advances in text-to-speech and speech enhancement, which combine adversarial and reconstruction losses to allow the generation of high-quality audio content from quantized embeddings. By training with structured dropout applied to quantizer layers, a single model can operate across variable bitrates from 3kbps to 18kbps, with a negligible quality loss when compared with models trained at fixed bitrates. In addition, the model is amenable to a low latency implementation, which supports streamable inference and runs in real time on a smartphone CPU.

Although on-the-fly teacher label generation tackles this issue, the training speed is significantly slower as the teacher model has to be evaluated every batch. In this paper, we reformulate the generation of teacher label as a codec problem. We propose a novel Multi-codebook Vector Quantization (MVQ) approach that compresses teacher embeddings to codebook indexes (CI). Based on this, a KD training framework (MVQ-KD) is proposed where a student model predicts the CI generated from the embeddings of a self-supervised pre-trained teacher model. Experiments on the LibriSpeech clean-100 hour show that MVQ-KD framework achieves comparable performance as traditional KD methods (11, 12), while requiring 256 times less storage. When the full LibriSpeech dataset is used, MVQ-KD framework results in 13.8% and 8.2% relative word error rate reductions (WERRs) for non -streaming transducer on test-clean and test-other and 4.0% and 4.9% for streaming transducer.

10.1109/taslp.2023.3320864,Disentangling Prosody Representations With Unsupervised Speech Reconstruction,"Human speech can be characterized by different components, including semantic content, speaker identity and prosodic information. Significant progress has been made in disentangling representations for semantic content and speaker identity in Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) and speaker verification tasks respectively. However, it is still an open challenging research question to extract prosodic information because of the intrinsic association of different attributes, such as timbre and rhythm, and because of the need for supervised training schemes to achieve robust large-scale and speaker-independent ASR. The aim of this paper is to address the disentanglement of emotional prosody from speech based on unsupervised reconstruction. Specifically, we identify, design, implement and integrate three crucial components in our proposed speech reconstruction model Prosody2Vec: (1) a unit encoder that transforms speech signals into discrete units for semantic content, (2) a pretrained speaker verification model to generate speaker identity embeddings, and (3) a trainable prosody encoder to learn prosody representations. We first pretrain the Prosody2Vec representations on unlabelled emotional speech corpora, then fine-tune the model on specific datasets to perform Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) and Emotional Voice Conversion (EVC) tasks. Both objective (weighted and unweighted accuracies) and subjective (mean opinion score) evaluations on the EVC task suggest that Prosody2Vec effectively captures general prosodic features that can be smoothly transferred to other emotional speech. In addition, our SER experiments on the IEMOCAP dataset reveal that the prosody features learned by Prosody2Vec are complementary and beneficial for the performance of widely used speech pretraining models and surpass the state-of-the-art methods when combining Prosody2Vec with HuBERT representations.

In 2023, Wang et al. introduced Vall-E, a Transformer-based neural codec language model, achieving state-of-the-art results in voice cloning. However, limited research has applied such models to the Indonesian language, leaving room for improvement in speech synthesis. This paper explores the development a TTS system using Vall-E and explores enhancements of the speech synthesis. The dataset, comprising audio-transcript pairs, was sourced from previous Indonesian speech processing research. Data preparation involved converting audio into codec tokens and transcripts into phoneme tokens. Following Wang et al., a neural codec language model was built and trained using open-source tools. Additionally, this paper explores the integration VoiceFixer tool for speech enhancement. The inclusion of VoiceFixer improved the naturalness MOS score from 3.34 to 3.95, demonstrating its effectiveness in enhancing speech quality.

Recently, the emergence of neural network-based models has significantly advanced the progress of ASR systems and speech coding, laying the foundation for building a speech compression method specially optimized for ASR systems. In this letter, we propose an ASR-oriented Speech Quantization (ASQ) method to reduce communication costs for speech recognition systems. In the proposed method, a speech quantization model first converts the speech into low bit rate tokens. Then the tokens are transmitted to the server and recognized by a quantized speech recognition model. The two models could be jointly trained in the end-to-end (E2E) style. To mitigate the performance degradation introduced by the quantization components, we design an entropy-guided 3-stage training method that encourages the model to fully utilize the token space and promote recognition accuracy. Experiment results on the LibriSpeech corpus show that compared to an existing non-quantized ASR model with a 256 kbps transmission bit rate, the proposed method can achieve a transmission bit rate of 0.6 kbps without any influence on word error rate (WER).

However, these models assume conditional independence between consecutive <i>F</i><sub>0 </sub>values, given the RNN state. In a previous study, we proposed autoregressive (AR) neural <i>F</i><sub>0</sub> models to capture the causal dependency of successive <i>F</i><sub>0</sub> values.

Prosody modeling has several challenges: 1) the extracted pitch used in previous prosody modeling works have inevitable errors, which hurts the prosody modeling; 2) different attributes of prosody (e.g., pitch, duration and energy) are dependent on each other and produce the natural prosody together; and 3) due to high variability of prosody and the limited amount of high-quality data for TTS training, the distribution of prosody cannot be fully shaped. To tackle these issues, we propose ProsoSpeech, which enhances the prosody using quantized latent vectors pre-trained on large-scale unpaired and low-quality text and speech data. Specifically, we first introduce a word-level prosody encoder, which quantizes the low-frequency band of the speech and compresses prosody at-tributes in the latent prosody vector (LPV). Then we introduce an LPV predictor, which predicts LPV given word sequence. We pre-train the LPV predictor on large-scale text and low-quality speech data and fine-tune it on the high-quality TTS dataset.

Specifically, a sequence of discrete representations derived in a self-supervised manner are predicted from the model and passed to a vocoder for speech reconstruction, while still facing the following challenges: 1) Acoustic multimodality: the discrete units derived from speech with same content could be indeterministic due to the acoustic property (e.g., rhythm, pitch, and energy), which causes deterioration of translation accuracy; 2) high latency: current S2ST systems utilize autoregressive models which predict each unit conditioned on the sequence previously generated, failing to take full advantage of parallelism. In this work, we propose TranSpeech, a speech-to-speech translation model with bilateral perturbation. To alleviate the acoustic multimodal problem, we propose bilateral perturbation (BiP), which consists of the style normalization and information enhancement stages, to learn only the linguistic information from speech samples and generate more deterministic representations. With reduced multimodality, we step forward and become the first to establish a non-autoregressive S2ST technique, which repeatedly masks and predicts unit choices and produces high-accuracy results in just a few cycles.

Specifically, a sequence of discrete representations derived in a self-supervised manner are predicted from the model and passed to a vocoder for speech reconstruction, while still facing the following challenges: 1) Acoustic multimodality: the discrete units derived from speech with same content could be indeterministic due to the acoustic property (e.g., rhythm, pitch, and energy), which causes deterioration of translation accuracy; 2) high latency: current S2ST systems utilize autoregressive models which predict each unit conditioned on the sequence previously generated, failing to take full advantage of parallelism. In this work, we propose TranSpeech, a speech-to-speech translation model with bilateral perturbation. To alleviate the acoustic multimodal problem, we propose bilateral perturbation (BiP), which consists of the style normalization and information enhancement stages, to learn only the linguistic information from speech samples and generate more deterministic representations. With reduced multimodality, we step forward and become the first to establish a non-autoregressive S2ST technique, which repeatedly masks and predicts unit choices and produces high-accuracy results in just a few cycles. Experimental results on three language pairs demonstrate that BiP yields an improvement of 2.9 BLEU on average compared with a baseline textless S2ST model.

What\ndifferentiates this paper from prior work on speech unit learning is the choice\nof training objective. Rather than using a reconstruction-based loss, we use a\ndiscriminative, multimodal grounding objective which forces the learned units\nto be useful for semantic image retrieval. We evaluate the sub-word units on\nthe ZeroSpeech 2019 challenge, achieving a 27.3\\% reduction in ABX error rate\nover the top-performing submission, while keeping the bitrate approximately the\nsame. We also present experiments demonstrating the noise robustness of these\nunits. Finally, we show that a model with multiple quantizers can\nsimultaneously learn phone-like detectors at a lower layer and word-like\ndetectors at a higher layer. We show that these detectors are highly accurate,\ndiscovering 279 words with an F1 score of greater than 0.5.\n",1,,include (junior:5),,,2019,,,"{""title"": ""Learning Hierarchical Discrete Linguistic Units from Visually-Grounded\\n Speech"", ""summary"": ""In this paper, we present a method for learning discrete linguistic units by\\nincorporating vector quantization layers into neural models of visually\\ngrounded speech.

10.21437/interspeech.2019-1518,Unsupervised Acoustic Unit Discovery for Speech Synthesis Using Discrete Latent-Variable Neural Networks,"For our submission to the ZeroSpeech 2019 challenge, we apply discrete latent-variable neural networks to unlabelled speech and use the discovered units for speech synthesis. Unsupervised discrete subword modelling could be useful for studies of phonetic category learning in infants or in low-resource speech technology requiring symbolic input. We use an autoencoder (AE) architecture with intermediate discretisation. We decouple acoustic unit discovery from speaker modelling by conditioning the AE's decoder on the training speaker identity. At test time, unit discovery is performed on speech from an unseen speaker, followed by unit decoding conditioned on a known target speaker to obtain reconstructed filterbanks. This output is fed to a neural vocoder to synthesise speech in the target speaker's voice. For discretisation, categorical variational autoencoders (CatVAEs), vector-quantised VAEs (VQ-VAEs) and straight-through estimation are compared at different compression levels on two languages. Our final model uses convolutional encoding, VQ-VAE discretisation, deconvolutional decoding and an FFTNet vocoder. We show that decoupled speaker conditioning intrinsically improves discrete acoustic representations, yielding competitive synthesis quality compared to the challenge baseline.",1,,include (junior:5),,,2019,,,"{""title"": ""Unsupervised Acoustic Unit Discovery for Speech Synthesis Using Discrete Latent-Variable Neural Networks"", ""summary"": ""For our submission to the ZeroSpeech 2019 challenge, we apply discrete latent-variable neural networks to unlabelled speech and use the discovered units for speech synthesis.
