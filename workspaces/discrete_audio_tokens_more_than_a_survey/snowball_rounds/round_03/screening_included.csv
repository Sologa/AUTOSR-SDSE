Speech translation can play a vital role in mitigating technological disparity and creating a more inclusive society. With a motive to contribute towards speech translation research for low-resource languages, our work presents a direct speech-to-speech translation model for one of the Indic languages called Punjabi to English.

10.18653/v1/2023.sigtyp-1.20,On the Nature of Discrete Speech Representations in Multilingual Self-supervised Models,"Self-supervision has emerged as an effective paradigm for learning representations of spoken language from raw audio without explicit labels or transcriptions. Self-supervised speech models, such as wav2vec 2.0 (Baevski et al., 2020) and HuBERT (Hsu et al., 2021), have shown significant promise in improving the performance across different speech processing tasks. One of the main advantages of self-supervised speech models is that they can be pre-trained on a large sample of languages (Conneau et al., 2020; Babu et al.,2022), which facilitates cross-lingual transfer for low-resource languages (San et al., 2021). State-of-the-art self-supervised speech models include a quantization module that transforms the continuous acoustic input into a sequence of discrete units. One of the key questions in this area is whether the discrete representations learned via self-supervision are language-specific or language-universal. In other words, we ask: do the discrete units learned by a multilingual speech model represent the same speech sounds across languages or do they differ based on the specific language being spoken? From the practical perspective, this question has important implications for the development of speech models that can generalize across languages, particularly for low-resource languages. Furthermore, examining the level of linguistic abstraction in speech models that lack symbolic supervision is also relevant to the field of human language acquisition (Dupoux, 2018).",1,,include (junior:5),,,2023,,,"{""title"": ""On the Nature of Discrete Speech Representations in Multilingual Self-supervised Models"", ""summary"": ""Self-supervision has emerged as an effective paradigm for learning representations of spoken language from raw audio without explicit labels or transcriptions.

This paper proposed a new thought for the autoregressive generation. Instead of iteratively predicting samples in a time sequence, the proposed model performs frequency-wise autoregressive generation (FAR) and bit-wise autoregressive generation (BAR) to synthesize speech. In FAR, a speech utterance is first split into different frequency subbands. The proposed model generates a subband conditioned on the previously generated one.

However, this approach suffers from the drawback of error accumulation at each stage. In contrast, the direct speech-to-speech translation model directly converts speech from the source language to the target language without relying on intermediate text generation, thereby avoiding the issue of incorrect transmission in cascading systems. Currently, there exist two categories for direct speech-to-speech translation methods.

The experimental evaluation with the JSUT corpus shows that the proposed method outperforms the conventional Transformer-TTS model with a non-autoregressive neural vocoder in naturalness, achieving the performance comparable to the reconstruction of the VQ-VAE model."", ""doi"": ""https://doi.org/10.48550/arxiv.2005.05525"", ""openalex_id"": ""https://openalex.org/W3024605872"", ""arxiv_id"": """", ""publication_date"": ""2020-05-12"", ""published"": ""2020-05-12"", ""source"": ""openalex_snowball""}",,https://openalex.org/W3024605872

In this paper, we propose a self-supervised framework based on contrastive loss of the pseudo-labels, obtained from an offline k-means quantizer (tokenizer).

The pseudo-con loss, within a batch of training, allows the model to cluster the instances of the same pseudo-label while separating the instances of a different pseudo-label. The proposed pseudo-con loss can also be combined with the cross entropy loss, commonly used in self-supervised learning schemes. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the pseudo-con loss applied for various SSL techniques, like hidden unit bidirectional encoder representations from transformers (HuBERT), best random quantizer (BEST-RQ) and hidden unit clustering (HUC).

10.1109/taslp.2023.3320864,Disentangling Prosody Representations With Unsupervised Speech Reconstruction,"Human speech can be characterized by different components, including semantic content, speaker identity and prosodic information. Significant progress has been made in disentangling representations for semantic content and speaker identity in Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) and speaker verification tasks respectively. However, it is still an open challenging research question to extract prosodic information because of the intrinsic association of different attributes, such as timbre and rhythm, and because of the need for supervised training schemes to achieve robust large-scale and speaker-independent ASR. The aim of this paper is to address the disentanglement of emotional prosody from speech based on unsupervised reconstruction. Specifically, we identify, design, implement and integrate three crucial components in our proposed speech reconstruction model Prosody2Vec: (1) a unit encoder that transforms speech signals into discrete units for semantic content, (2) a pretrained speaker verification model to generate speaker identity embeddings, and (3) a trainable prosody encoder to learn prosody representations. We first pretrain the Prosody2Vec representations on unlabelled emotional speech corpora, then fine-tune the model on specific datasets to perform Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) and Emotional Voice Conversion (EVC) tasks. Both objective (weighted and unweighted accuracies) and subjective (mean opinion score) evaluations on the EVC task suggest that Prosody2Vec effectively captures general prosodic features that can be smoothly transferred to other emotional speech. In addition, our SER experiments on the IEMOCAP dataset reveal that the prosody features learned by Prosody2Vec are complementary and beneficial for the performance of widely used speech pretraining models and surpass the state-of-the-art methods when combining Prosody2Vec with HuBERT representations.

Method: We introduce a novel, text-independent forced alignment model that autonomously recognises individual phonemes and their boundaries, addressing these limitations. Our approach leverages an advanced, pre-trained wav2vec 2.0 model to segment speech into tokens and recognise them automatically. To accurately identify phoneme boundaries, we utilise an unsupervised segmentation tool, UnsupSeg. Labelling of segments employs nearest-neighbour classification with wav2vec 2.0 labels, before connectionist temporal classification (CTC) collapse, determining class labels based on maximum overlap. Additional post-processing, including overfitting cleaning and voice activity detection, is implemented to enhance segmentation. Results: We benchmarked our model against existing methods using the TIMIT dataset for normal speakers and, for the first time, evaluated its performance on the TORGO dataset containing SSD speakers. Our model demonstrated competitive performance, achieving a harmonic mean score of 76.88% on TIMIT and 70.31% on TORGO. Implications: This research presents a significant advancement in the assessment and diagnosis of SSDs, offering a more objective and less biased approach than traditional methods. Our model’s effectiveness, particularly with SSD speakers, opens new avenues for research and clinical application in speech pathology."", ""doi"": ""https://doi.org/10.3390/s23249650"", ""openalex_id"": ""https://openalex.org/W4389388460"", ""arxiv_id"": """", ""publication_date"": ""2023-12-06"", ""published"": ""2023-12-06"", ""source"": ""openalex_snowball""}",,https://openalex.org/W4389388460
10.1111/cogs.13427,Computational Modeling of the Segmentation of Sentence Stimuli From an Infant Word‐Finding Study,"Abstract Computational models of infant word‐finding typically operate over transcriptions of infant‐directed speech corpora. It is now possible to test models of word segmentation on speech materials, rather than transcriptions of speech. We propose that such modeling efforts be conducted over the speech of the experimental stimuli used in studies measuring infants' capacity for learning from spoken sentences. Correspondence with infant outcomes in such experiments is an appropriate benchmark for models of infants. We demonstrate such an analysis by applying the DP‐Parser model of Algayres and colleagues to auditory stimuli used in infant psycholinguistic experiments by Pelucchi and colleagues. The DP‐Parser model takes speech as input, and creates multiple overlapping embeddings from each utterance. Prospective words are identified as clusters of similar embedded segments. This allows segmentation of each utterance into possible words, using a dynamic programming method that maximizes the frequency of constituent segments. We show that DP‐Parse mimics American English learners' performance in extracting words from Italian sentences, favoring the segmentation of words with high syllabic transitional probability.

In this work, we focus on phoneme recognition using Allosaurus, a method for multilingual recognition based on phonetic annotation, which incorporates phonological knowledge through a language-dependent allophone layer that associates a universal narrow phone-set with the phonemes that appear in each language. To evaluate in a challenging real-world scenario, we curate phone recognition datasets for Bukusu and Saamia, two varieties of the Luhya language cluster of western Kenya and eastern Uganda. To our knowledge, these datasets are the first of their kind.

Neural audio codecs efficiently compress audio into discrete codes, revealing the possibility of applying text modeling approaches to speech generation. However, the complexity of predicting multiple tokens per frame from several codebooks, as necessitated by audio codec models with residual quantizers, poses a significant challenge. The proposed system first uses a transducer architecture to learn monotonic alignments between tokenized text and speech codec tokens for the first codebook. Next, a non-autoregressive Transformer predicts the remaining codes using the alignment extracted from transducer loss. The proposed system is trained end-to-end.

This necessitates a lexicon that maps each word to a sequence of subword units. Development of a phonetic lexicon for a language requires linguistic knowledge as well as human effort, which may not be always readily available, particularly for under-resourced languages. In such scenarios, an alternative approach is to use a lexicon based on units such as, graphemes or subword units automatically derived from the acoustic data. This article focuses on automatic subword unit based lexicon development using methods that are employed for development of grapheme-based systems. Specifically, we present a novel hidden Markov model (HMM) based formalism for automatic derivation of subword units and pronunciation generation using only transcribed speech data. In this approach, the subword units are derived from the clustered context-dependent units in a grapheme based system using the maximum-likelihood criterion. The subword unit based pronunciations are then generated by learning either a deterministic or a probabilistic relationship between the graphemes and the acoustic subword units (ASWUs). In this article, we first establish the proposed framework on a well-resourced language by comparing it against related approaches in the literature and investigating the transferability of the derived subword units to other domains. We then show the scalability of the proposed approach on real under-resourced scenarios by conducting studies on Scottish Gaelic, a genuinely under-resourced language, and comparing the approach against state-of-the-art grapheme-based ASR approaches. Our experimental studies on English show that the derived subword units can not only lead to better ASR systems compared to graphemes, but can also be transferred across domains.

The unsupervised spoken term discovery system is experimented with online lectures covering different topics by different speakers. It is shown that the system learns the phonetic information of the language and can discover frequent spoken terms that align with text transcription. By using information retrieval technology such as word embedding and TFIDF, it is shown that the discovered keywords can be further used for topic comparison."", ""doi"": ""https://doi.org/10.48550/arxiv.2011.14060"", ""openalex_id"": ""https://openalex.org/W3110585608"", ""arxiv_id"": """", ""publication_date"": ""2020-11-28"", ""published"": ""2020-11-28"", ""source"": ""openalex_snowball""}",,https://openalex.org/W3110585608

In the query matching phase, a document state matching (DSM) approach is proposed to represent documents as ASM sequences, which are matched to the query frames. In this way, not only do the ASMs better model the signal distributions and time trajectories of speech, but the much-smaller number of states than frames for the documents leads to a much lower computational load.

10.1109/taslp.2019.2911164,Low Resource Keyword Search With Synthesized Crosslingual Exemplars,"The transfer of acoustic data across languages has been shown to improve keyword search (KWS) performance in data-scarce settings. In this paper, we propose a way of performing this transfer that reduces the impact of the prevalence of out-of-vocabulary (OOV) terms on KWS in such a setting. We investigate a novel usage of multilingual features for KWS with very little training data in the target languages.

Harmonizer employs a unified approach to convert diverse, non-linguistic signals into discrete tokens via its FusionQuantizer architecture, built on FluxFormer, to efficiently capture essential signal features while minimizing complexity. We enhance features through STFT-based spectral decomposition, Hilbert transform analytic signal extraction, and SCLAHE spectrogram contrast optimization, and train using a composite loss function to produce reliable embeddings and construct a robust vector vocabulary.

,Unsupervised Word Discovery from Phonetic Input Using Nested Pitman-Yor Language Modeling,"Abstract — In this paper we consider the unsupervised word discovery from phonetic input.

The under-lying statistical model is that of a Pitman-Yor process, a concept known from Bayesian non-parametrics, which allows for an a priori unknown and unlimited number of different words. Using a hierarchy of Pitman-Yor processes, language models of different order can be employed and nesting it with another hierarchy of Pitman-Yor processes on the phone level allows for backing off unknown word unigrams by phone m-grams.

We find the former to be more accurate since it builds a good vocabulary of the data through vq-wav2vec [1] to enable learning of effective representations in subsequent BERT training. Different to previous work, we directly fine-tune the pre-trained BERT models on transcribed speech using a Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) loss instead of feeding the representations into a task-specific model. We also propose a BERT-style model learning directly from the continuous audio data and compare pre-training on raw audio to spectral features. Fine-tuning a BERT model on 10 hour of labeled Librispeech data with a vq-wav2vec vocabulary is almost as good as the best known reported system trained on 100 hours of labeled data on testclean, while achieving a 25% WER reduction on test-other.

,Linguistically-motivated sub-word modeling with applications to speech recognition,"Despite the proliferation of speech-enabled applications and devices, speech-driven human-machine interaction still faces several challenges. One of theses issues is the new word or the out-of-vocabulary (OOV) problem, which occurs when the underlying automatic speech recognizer (ASR) encounters a word it does not know. With ASR being deployed in constantly evolving domains such as restaurant ratings, or music querying, as well as on handheld devices, the new word problem continues to arise. This thesis is concerned with the OOV problem, and in particular with the process of modeling and learning the lexical properties of an OOV word through a linguistically-motivated sub-syllabic model. The linguistic model is designed using a context-free grammar which describes the sub-syllabic structure of English words, and encapsulates phonotactic and phonological constraints. The context-free grammar is supported by a probability model, which captures the statistics of the parses generated by the grammar and encodes spatio-temporal context. The two main outcomes of the grammar design are: (1) sub-word units, which encode pronunciation information, and can be viewed as clusters of phonemes; and (2) a high-quality alignment between graphemic and sub-word units, which results in hybrid entities denoted as spellnemes. The spellneme units are used in the design of a statistical bi-directional letter-to-sound (L2S) model, which plays a significant role in automatically learning the spelling and pronunciation of a new word. The sub-word units and the L2S model are assessed on the task of automatic lexicon generation. In a first set of experiments, knowledge of the spelling of the lexicon is assumed. It is shown that the phonemic pronunciations associated with the lexicon can be successfully learned using the L2S model as well as a sub-word recognizer. In a second set of experiments, the assumption of perfect spelling knowledge is relaxed, and an iterative and unsupervised algorithm, denoted as Turbo-style, makes use of spoken instances of both spellings and words to learn the lexical entries in a dictionary. Sub-word speech recognition is also embedded in a parallel fashion as a back-off mechanism for a word recognizer. The resulting hybrid model is evaluated in a lexical access application, whereby a word recognizer first attempts to recognize an isolated word. Upon failure of the word recognizer, the sub-word recognizer is manually triggered. Preliminary results show that such a hybrid set-up outperforms a large-vocabulary recognizer. Finally, the sub-word units are embedded in a flat hybrid 00V model for continuous ASR. The hybrid ASR is deployed as a front-end to a song retrieval application, which is queried via spoken lyrics. Vocabulary compression and open-ended query recognition are achieved by designing a hybrid ASR. The performance of the front-end recognition system is reported in terms of sentence, word, and sub-word error rates. The hybrid ASR is shown to outperform a word-only system over a range of out-of-vocabulary rates (1%-50%). The retrieval performance is thoroughly assessed as a function of ASR N-best size, language model order, and the index size. Moreover, it is shown that the sub-words outperform alternative linguistically-motivated sub-lexical units such as phonemes. Finally, it is observed that a dramatic vocabulary compression - by more than a factor of 10 - is accompanied by a minor loss in song retrieval performance.

,Unsupervised clustering of audio data for acoustic modelling in automatic speech recognition systems,"This thesis presents a system that is designed to replace the manual process of generating a pronunciation dictionary for use in automatic speech recognition. The proposed system has several stages. The first stage segments the audio into what will be known as the subword units, using a frequency domain method. In the second stage, dynamic time warping is used to determine the similarity between the segments of each possible pair of these acoustic segments. These similarities are used to cluster similar acoustic segments into acoustic clusters. The final stage derives a pronunciation dictionary from the orthography of the training data and corresponding sequence of acoustic clusters. This process begins with an initial mapping between words and their sequence of clusters, established by Viterbi alignment with the orthographic transcription. The dictionary is refined iteratively by pruning redundant mappings, hidden Markov model estimation and Viterbi re-alignment in each iteration. This approach is evaluated experimentally by applying it to two subsets of the TIMIT corpus. It is found that, when test words are repeated often in the training material, the approach leads to a system whose accuracy is almost as good as one trained using the phonetic transcriptions.

10.1109/taslp.2021.3129353,Scalable and Efficient Neural Speech Coding: A Hybrid Design,"We present a scalable and efficient neural waveform coding system for speech\ncompression. We formulate the speech coding problem as an autoencoding task,\nwhere a convolutional neural network (CNN) performs encoding and decoding as a\nneural waveform codec (NWC) during its feedforward routine. The proposed NWC\nalso defines quantization and entropy coding as a trainable module, so the\ncoding artifacts and bitrate control are handled during the optimization\nprocess.

10.48550/arxiv.2005.07884,Improved Prosody from Learned F0 Codebook Representations for VQ-VAE Speech Waveform Reconstruction,"Vector Quantized Variational AutoEncoders (VQ-VAE) are a powerful representation learning framework that can discover discrete groups of features from a speech signal without supervision. Until now, the VQ-VAE architecture has previously modeled individual types of speech features, such as only phones or only F0. This paper introduces an important extension to VQ-VAE for learning F0-related suprasegmental information simultaneously along with traditional phone features.The proposed framework uses two encoders such that the F0 trajectory and speech waveform are both input to the system, therefore two separate codebooks are learned.

,Unsupervised pattern discovery in speech: applications to word acquisition and speaker segmentation,"We present a novel approach to speech processing based on the principle of pattern discovery. Our work represents a departure from traditional models of speech recognition, where the end goal is to classify speech into categories defined by a pre-specified inventory of lexical units (i.e. phones or words). Instead, we attempt to discover such an inventory in an unsupervised manner by exploiting the structure of repeating patterns within the speech signal. We show how pattern discovery can be used to automatically acquire lexical entities directly from an untranscribed audio stream. Our approach to unsupervised word acquisition utilizes a segmental variant of a widely used dynamic programming technique, which allows us to find matching acoustic patterns between spoken utterances. By aggregating information about these matching patterns across audio streams, we demonstrate how to group similar acoustic sequences together to form clusters corresponding to lexical entities such as words and short multi-word phrases. On a corpus of academic lecture material, we demonstrate that clusters found using this technique exhibit high purity and that many of the corresponding lexical identities are relevant to the underlying audio stream. We demonstrate two applications of our pattern discovery procedure. First, we propose and evaluate two methods for automatically identifying sound clusters generated through pattern discovery. Our results show that high identification accuracy can be achieved for single word clusters using a constrained isolated word recognizer. Second, we apply acoustic pattern matching to the problem of speaker segmentation by attempting to find word-level speech patterns that are repeated by the same speaker. When used to segment a ten hour corpus of multi-speaker lectures, we found that our approach is able to generate segmentations that correlate well to independently generated human segmentations.

This framework employs a tokenizer to convert query examples and test utterances into frame-level posteriorgrams, and applies dynamic time warping to match the query posteriorgrams with test posteriorgrams to locate possible occurrences of the query term. It is not trivial to design a reliable tokenizer due to heterogeneous test conditions and the limitation of training resources.

Specifically, a sequence of discrete representations derived in a self-supervised manner are predicted from the model and passed to a vocoder for speech reconstruction, while still facing the following challenges: 1) Acoustic multimodality: the discrete units derived from speech with same content could be indeterministic due to the acoustic property (e.g., rhythm, pitch, and energy), which causes deterioration of translation accuracy; 2) high latency: current S2ST systems utilize autoregressive models which predict each unit conditioned on the sequence previously generated, failing to take full advantage of parallelism. In this work, we propose TranSpeech, a speech-to-speech translation model with bilateral perturbation. To alleviate the acoustic multimodal problem, we propose bilateral perturbation (BiP), which consists of the style normalization and information enhancement stages, to learn only the linguistic information from speech samples and generate more deterministic representations. With reduced multimodality, we step forward and become the first to establish a non-autoregressive S2ST technique, which repeatedly masks and predicts unit choices and produces high-accuracy results in just a few cycles. Experimental results on three language pairs demonstrate that BiP yields an improvement of 2.9 BLEU on average compared with a baseline textless S2ST model. Moreover, our parallel decoding shows a significant reduction of inference latency, enabling speedup up to 21.4x than autoregressive technique.

The lip-reading WER is further reduced to 26.9% when using all 433 hours of labeled data from LRS3 and combined with self-training. Using our audio-visual representation on the same benchmark for audio-only speech recognition leads to a 40% relative WER reduction over the state-of-the-art performance (1.3% vs 2.3%).

10.48550/arxiv.2305.02765,HiFi-Codec: Group-residual Vector quantization for High Fidelity Audio Codec,"Audio codec models are widely used in audio communication as a crucial technique for compressing audio into discrete representations. Nowadays, audio codec models are increasingly utilized in generation fields as intermediate representations. For instance, AudioLM is an audio generation model that uses the discrete representation of SoundStream as a training target, while VALL-E employs the Encodec model as an intermediate feature to aid TTS tasks. Despite their usefulness, two challenges persist: (1) training these audio codec models can be difficult due to the lack of publicly available training processes and the need for large-scale data and GPUs; (2) achieving good reconstruction performance requires many codebooks, which increases the burden on generation models. In this study, we propose a group-residual vector quantization (GRVQ) technique and use it to develop a novel \textbf{Hi}gh \textbf{Fi}delity Audio Codec model, HiFi-Codec, which only requires 4 codebooks. We train all the models using publicly available TTS data such as LibriTTS, VCTK, AISHELL, and more, with a total duration of over 1000 hours, using 8 GPUs. Our experimental results show that HiFi-Codec outperforms Encodec in terms of reconstruction performance despite requiring only 4 codebooks.

10.21437/interspeech.2019-1518,Unsupervised Acoustic Unit Discovery for Speech Synthesis Using Discrete Latent-Variable Neural Networks,"For our submission to the ZeroSpeech 2019 challenge, we apply discrete latent-variable neural networks to unlabelled speech and use the discovered units for speech synthesis. Unsupervised discrete subword modelling could be useful for studies of phonetic category learning in infants or in low-resource speech technology requiring symbolic input. We use an autoencoder (AE) architecture with intermediate discretisation. We decouple acoustic unit discovery from speaker modelling by conditioning the AE's decoder on the training speaker identity. At test time, unit discovery is performed on speech from an unseen speaker, followed by unit decoding conditioned on a known target speaker to obtain reconstructed filterbanks. This output is fed to a neural vocoder to synthesise speech in the target speaker's voice. For discretisation, categorical variational autoencoders (CatVAEs), vector-quantised VAEs (VQ-VAEs) and straight-through estimation are compared at different compression levels on two languages. Our final model uses convolutional encoding, VQ-VAE discretisation, deconvolutional decoding and an FFTNet vocoder. We show that decoupled speaker conditioning intrinsically improves discrete acoustic representations, yielding competitive synthesis quality compared to the challenge baseline.",1,,include (junior:5),,,2019,,,"{""title"": ""Unsupervised Acoustic Unit Discovery for Speech Synthesis Using Discrete Latent-Variable Neural Networks"", ""summary"": ""For our submission to the ZeroSpeech 2019 challenge, we apply discrete latent-variable neural networks to unlabelled speech and use the discovered units for speech synthesis.

,The challenge of realistic music generation: modelling raw audio at scale,"Realistic music generation is a challenging task. When building generative models of music that are learnt from data, typically high-level representations such as scores or MIDI are used that abstract away the idiosyncrasies of a particular performance. But these nuances are very important for our perception of musicality and realism, so in this work we embark on modelling music in the raw audio domain. It has been shown that autoregressive models excel at generating raw audio waveforms of speech, but when applied to music, we find them biased towards capturing local signal structure at the expense of modelling long-range correlations. This is problematic because music exhibits structure at many different timescales. In this work, we explore autoregressive discrete autoencoders (ADAs) as a means to enable autoregressive models to capture long-range correlations in waveforms. We find that they allow us to unconditionally generate piano music directly in the raw audio domain, which shows stylistic consistency across tens of seconds.",1,,include (senior:5),,,2018,,,"{""title"": ""The challenge of realistic music generation: modelling raw audio at scale"", ""summary"": ""Realistic music generation is a challenging task.
