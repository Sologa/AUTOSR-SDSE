    "title": "Multitask Feature Learning for Low-Resource Query-by-Example Spoken Term Detection",
    "abstract": "We propose a novel technique that learns a low-dimensional feature representation from unlabeled data of a target language, and labeled data from a nontarget language. The technique is studied as a solution to query-by-example spoken term detection (QbE-STD) for a low-resource language. We extract low-dimensional features from a bottle-neck layer of a multitask deep neural network, which is jointly trained with speech data from the low-resource target language and resource-rich nontarget language. The proposed feature learning technique aims to extract acoustic features that offer phonetic discriminability. It explores a new way of leveraging cross-lingual speech data to overcome the resource limitation in the target language. We conduct QbE-STD experiments using the dynamic time warping distance of the multitask bottle-neck features between the query and the search database. The QbE-STD process does not rely on an automatic speech recognition pipeline of the target language. We validate the effectiveness of multitask feature learning through a series of comparative experiments.",

    "abstract": "Background sound is an informative form of art that is helpful in providing a more immersive experience in real-application voice conversion (VC) scenarios. However, prior research about VC, mainly focusing on clean voices, pay rare attention to VC with background sound. The critical problem for preserving background sound in VC is inevitable speech distortion by the neural separation model and the cascade mismatch between the source separation model and the VC model. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end framework via multitask learning which sequentially cascades a source separation (SS) module, a bottleneck feature extraction module and a VC module. Specifically, the source separation task explicitly considers critical phase information and limits the distortion caused by the imperfect separation process. The source separation task, the typical VC task and the unified task share a uniform reconstruction loss constrained by joint training to reduce the mismatch between the SS and VC modules. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed framework significantly outperforms the baseline systems while achieving comparable quality and speaker similarity to the VC models trained with clean data.",

One solution to mitigate these concerns involves concealing speaker identities before sharing speech data, also referred to as speaker anonymization. In our previous work, we have developed an automatic speaker verification (ASV)-model-free anonymization framework to protect speaker privacy while preserving speech intelligibility. Although the framework ranked first place in VoicePrivacy 2022 challenge, the anonymization was imperfect, since the speaker distinguishability of the anonymized speech was deteriorated. To address this issue, in this paper, we directly model the formant distribution and fundamental frequency (F0) to represent speaker identity and anonymize the source speech by the uniformly scaling formant and F0. By directly scaling the formant and F0, the speaker distinguishability degradation of the anonymized speech caused by the introduction of other speakers is prevented.

Most of the state-of-the-art approaches convert emotions for seen speaker-emotion combinations only. In this paper, we tackle the problem of converting the emotion of speakers whose only neutral data are present during the time of training and testing (i.e., unseen speaker-emotion combinations). To this end, we extend a recently proposed StartGANv2-VC architecture by utilizing dual encoders for learning the speaker and emotion style embeddings separately along with dual domain source classifiers. For achieving the conversion to unseen speaker-emotion combinations, we propose a Virtual Domain Pairing (VDP) training strategy, which virtually incorporates the speaker-emotion pairs that are not present in the real data without compromising the min-max game of a discriminator and generator in adversarial training. We evaluate the proposed method using a Hindi emotional database.",

We assume to have a corpus of neutral non-expressive data from a target speaker and supporting conversational expressive data from different speakers. Our goal is to build a TTS system that is expressive, while retaining the target speaker's identity. The proposed approach relies on voice conversion to first generate high-quality data from the set of supporting expressive speakers. The voice converted data is then pooled with natural data from the target speaker and used to train a single-speaker multi-style TTS system. We provide evidence that this approach is efficient, flexible, and scalable. The method is evaluated using one or more supporting speakers, as well as a variable amount of supporting data. We further provide evidence that this approach allows some controllability of speaking style, when using multiple supporting speakers.

In this paper, we build on the recognition-synthesis framework and propose a one-shot voice conversion approach for style transfer based on speaker adaptation. First, a speaker normalization module is adopted to remove speaker-related information in bottleneck features extracted by ASR. Second, we adopt weight regularization in the adaptation process to prevent over-fitting caused by using only one utterance from target speaker as training data. Finally, to comprehensively decouple the speech factors, i.e., content, speaker, style, and transfer source style to the target, a prosody module is used to extract prosody representation.

Beyond text and image generation, in this work, we explore the possibility of utilizing text descriptions to guide speech synthesis. Thus, we develop a text-to-speech (TTS) system (dubbed as PromptTTS) that takes a prompt with both style and content descriptions as input to synthesize the corresponding speech. Specifically, PromptTTS consists of a style encoder and a content encoder to extract the corresponding representations from the prompt, and a speech decoder to synthesize speech according to the extracted style and content representations. Compared with previous works in controllable TTS that require users to have acoustic knowledge to understand style factors such as prosody and pitch, PromptTTS is more user-friendly since text descriptions are a more natural way to express speech style (e.g., \"A lady whispers to her friend slowly\"). Given that there is no TTS dataset with prompts, to benchmark the task of PromptTTS, we construct and release a dataset containing prompts with style and content information and the corresponding speech. Experiments show that PromptTTS can generate speech with precise style control and high speech quality.

As most data is unlabeled, unsupervised feature selection has attracted more and more attention in recent years. Discriminant analysis has been proven to be a powerful technique to select discriminative features for supervised feature selection. To apply discriminant analysis, we usually need label information which is absent for unlabeled data. This gap makes it challenging to apply discriminant analysis for unsupervised feature selection. In this paper, we investigate how to exploit discriminant analysis in unsupervised scenarios to select discriminative features. We introduce the concept of pseudo labels, which enable discriminant analysis on unlabeled data, propose a novel unsupervised feature selection framework DisUFS which incorporates learning discriminative features with generating pseudo labels, and develop an effective algorithm for DisUFS. Experimental results on different types of real-world data demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework DisUFS.

In this paper, we propose a three-step unsupervised approach to zero resource speech processing, which does not require any other information/dataset.

The second step involves clustering the varying-length segments into a finite number of clusters so that each segment can be labeled with a cluster index. The unsupervised transcriptions, thus obtained, can be thought of as a sequence of virtual phone labels. In the third step, a deep neural network classifier is trained to map the feature vectors extracted from the signal to its corresponding virtual phone label. The virtual phone posteriors extracted from the DNN are used as features in the zero resource speech processing. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is evaluated on both ABX and spoken term discovery tasks (STD) using spontaneous American English and Tsonga language datasets, provided as part of zero resource 2015 challenge.

Embedded segmental K-means (ES-KMeans) discovers both the word boundaries and the word types from raw data. Starting from an initial set of subword boundaries, the ES-Kmeans iteratively eliminates some of the boundaries to arrive at frequently occurring longer word patterns. Notice that the initial word boundaries will not be adjusted during the process. As a result, the performance of the ES-Kmeans critically depends on the initial subword boundaries.

In this paper, we propose to use a phoneme segmentation method that produces boundaries closer to true boundaries for ES-KMeans initialization. The use of shorter units increases the number of initial boundaries which leads to a significant increment in the computational complexity.

    "abstract": "This paper presents a study of spectral clustering-based approaches to acoustic segment modeling (ASM). ASM aims at finding the underlying phoneme-like speech units and building the corresponding acoustic models in the unsupervised setting, where no prior linguistic knowledge and manual transcriptions are available. A typical ASM process involves three stages, namely initial segmentation, segment labeling, and iterative modeling. This work focuses on the improvement of segment labeling. Specifically, we use posterior features as the segment representations, and apply spectral clustering algorithms on the posterior representations. We propose a Gaussian component clustering (GCC) approach and a segment clustering (SC) approach. GCC applies spectral clustering on a set of Gaussian components, and SC applies spectral clustering on a large number of speech segments. Moreover, to exploit the complementary information of different posterior representations, a multiview segment clustering (MSC) approach is proposed. MSC simultaneously utilizes multiple posterior representations to cluster speech segments. To address the computational problem of spectral clustering in dealing with large numbers of speech segments, we use inner product similarity graph and make reformulations to avoid the explicit computation of the affinity matrix and Laplacian matrix. We carried out two sets of experiments for evaluation. First, we evaluated the ASM accuracy on the OGI-MTS dataset, and it was shown that our approach could yield 18.7% relative purity improvement and 15.1% relative NMI improvement compared with the baseline approach. Second, we examined the performances of our approaches in the real application of zero-resource query-by-example spoken term detection on SWS2012 dataset, and it was shown that our approaches could provide consistent improvement on four different testing scenarios with three evaluation metrics.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents a novel semi-supervised end-to-end automatic speech recognition (ASR) method that employs consistency training with the use of unlabeled data. In consistency training, unlabeled data can be utilized for constraining a model such that it becomes invariant to small deformation. In fact, considering consistency can make the model robust to a variety of input examples. While previous studies have applied consistency training to primitive classification problems, no studies have employed consistency training to tackle sequence-to-sequence generation problems including end-to- end ASR. One problem is that existing consistency training schemes cannot take sequence-level generation consistency into consideration. In this paper, we propose a sequence-level consistency training scheme specialized to handle sequence-to-sequence generation problems. Our key idea is to consider the consistency of the generation function by utilizing beam search decoding results. For semi- supervised learning, we adopt Transformer as the end-to-end ASR model, and SpecAugment as the deformation function in consistency training. Our experiments show that our semi-supervised learning proposal with sequence-level consistency training can efficiently improve ASR performance using unlabeled speech data.",

      "summary": "This paper presents a novel semi-supervised end-to-end automatic speech recognition (ASR) method that employs consistency training with the use of unlabeled data. In consistency training, unlabeled data can be utilized for constraining a model such that it becomes invariant to small deformation. In fact, considering consistency can make the model robust to a variety of input examples. While previous studies have applied consistency training to primitive classification problems, no studies have employed consistency training to tackle sequence-to-sequence generation problems including end-to- end ASR. One problem is that existing consistency training schemes cannot take sequence-level generation consistency into consideration. In this paper, we propose a sequence-level consistency training scheme specialized to handle sequence-to-sequence generation problems. Our key idea is to consider the consistency of the generation function by utilizing beam search decoding results. For semi- supervised learning, we adopt Transformer as the end-to-end ASR model, and SpecAugment as the deformation function in consistency training. Our experiments show that our semi-supervised learning proposal with sequence-level consistency training can efficiently improve ASR performance using unlabeled speech data.",

We propose to use language-mismatched phoneme recognizers to assist unsupervised segmentation and segment clustering of a new language. Using a language-mismatched recognizer, an input utterance is divided into many variable-length segments. Each segment is represented by a feature vector that is derived from the phoneme posterior probabilities. A spectral clustering algorithm is developed to group the segments into a prescribed number of clusters, which represent a set of basic speech units in the target language. By exploiting multiple recognizers for different languages, a wider phonetic space can be covered, leading to improved performance of segmentation and clustering.

In this work, we focus on gaining a deeper understanding of how general these representations might be, and how individual phones are getting improved in a multilingual setting. To that end, we select a phonetically diverse set of languages, and perform a series of monolingual, multilingual and crosslingual (zero-shot) experiments.

We observe significant improvements across all languages in the multilingual setting, and stark degradation in the crosslingual setting, where the model, among other errors, considers Javanese as a tone language.

    "title": "How Phonotactics Affect Multilingual and Zero-Shot ASR Performance",
    "abstract": "The idea of combining multiple languages' recordings to train a single\\nautomatic speech recognition (ASR) model brings the promise of the emergence of\\nuniversal speech representation. Recently, a Transformer encoder-decoder model\\nhas been shown to leverage multilingual data well in IPA transcriptions of\\nlanguages presented during training. However, the representations it learned\\nwere not successful in zero-shot transfer to unseen languages. Because that\\nmodel lacks an explicit factorization of the acoustic model (AM) and language\\nmodel (LM), it is unclear to what degree the performance suffered from\\ndifferences in pronunciation or the mismatch in phonotactics. To gain more\\ninsight into the factors limiting zero-shot ASR transfer, we replace the\\nencoder-decoder with a hybrid ASR system consisting of a separate AM and LM.\\nThen, we perform an extensive evaluation of monolingual, multilingual, and\\ncrosslingual (zero-shot) acoustic and language models on a set of 13\\nphonetically diverse languages. We show that the gain from modeling\\ncrosslingual phonotactics is limited, and imposing a too strong model can hurt\\nthe zero-shot transfer. Furthermore, we find that a multilingual LM hurts a\\nmultilingual ASR system's performance, and retaining only the target language's\\nphonotactic data in LM training is preferable.\\n",
