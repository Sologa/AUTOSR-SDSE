10.1109/icassp48485.2024.10446418,Generation-Based Target Speech Extraction with Speech Discretization and Vocoder,"Target speech extraction (TSE) is a task aiming at isolating the speech of a specific target speaker from an audio mixture, with the help of an auxiliary recording of that target speaker. Most existing TSE methods employ discrimination-based models to estimate the target speaker's proportion in the mixture, but they often fail to compensate for the missing or highly corrupted frequency components in the speech signal. In contrast, the generation-based methods can naturally handle such scenarios via speech resynthesis. In this paper, we propose a novel discrete token based TSE approach by combining state-of-the-art speech discretization and vocoder techniques. By predicting a sequence of discrete tokens with the auxiliary audio and employing a vocoder that takes discrete tokens as input, the target speech can be effectively re-synthesized while eliminating interference.

10.1109/asru51503.2021.9688253,w2v-BERT: Combining Contrastive Learning and Masked Language Modeling for Self-Supervised Speech Pre-Training,"Motivated by the success of masked language modeling (MLM) in pre-training natural language processing models, we propose w2v-BERT that explores MLM for self-supervised speech representation learning. w2v-BERT is a framework that combines contrastive learning and MLM, where the former trains the model to discretize input continuous speech signals into a finite set of discriminative speech tokens, and the latter trains the model to learn contextualized speech representations via solving a masked prediction task consuming the discretized tokens. In contrast to existing MLM-based speech pre-training frameworks such as HuBERT, which relies on an iterative re-clustering and re-training process, or vq-wav2vec, which concatenates two separately trained modules, w2v-BERT can be optimized in an end-to-end fashion by solving the two self-supervised tasks (the contrastive task and MLM) simultaneously. Our experiments show that w2v-BERT achieves competitive results compared to current state-of-the-art pre-trained models on the LibriSpeech benchmarks when using the Libri-Light 60k corpus as the unsupervised data. In particular, when compared to published models such as conformer-based wav2vec 2.0 and HuBERT, our model shows 5% to 10% relative WER reduction on the test-clean and test-other subsets. When applied to the Google's Voice Search traffic dataset, w2v-BERT outperforms our internal conformer-based wav2vec 2.0 by more than 30% relatively.",1,,include (senior:5),,,2021,,,"{""title"": ""w2v-BERT: Combining Contrastive Learning and Masked Language Modeling for Self-Supervised Speech Pre-Training"", ""summary"": ""Motivated by the success of masked language modeling (MLM) in pre-training natural language processing models, we propose w2v-BERT that explores MLM for self-supervised speech representation learning. w2v-BERT is a framework that combines contrastive learning and MLM, where the former trains the model to discretize input continuous speech signals into a finite set of discriminative speech tokens, and the latter trains the model to learn contextualized speech representations via solving a masked prediction task consuming the discretized tokens.

10.1109/taslp.2023.3288409,AudioLM: A Language Modeling Approach to Audio Generation,"We introduce AudioLM, a framework for high-quality audio generation with long-term consistency. AudioLM maps the input audio to a sequence of discrete tokens and casts audio generation as a language modeling task in this representation space. We show how existing audio tokenizers provide different trade-offs between reconstruction quality and long-term structure, and we propose a hybrid tokenization scheme to achieve both objectives. Namely, we leverage the discretized activations of a masked language model pre-trained on audio to capture long-term structure and the discrete codes produced by a neural audio codec to achieve high-quality synthesis. By training on large corpora of raw audio waveforms, AudioLM learns to generate natural and coherent continuations given short prompts. When trained on speech, and without any transcript or annotation, AudioLM generates syntactically and semantically plausible speech continuations while also maintaining speaker identity and prosody for unseen speakers. Furthermore, we demonstrate how our approach extends beyond speech by generating coherent piano music continuations, despite being trained without any symbolic representation of music.",1,,include (junior:4),,,2023,,,"{""title"": ""AudioLM: A Language Modeling Approach to Audio Generation"", ""summary"": ""We introduce AudioLM, a framework for high-quality audio generation with long-term consistency.
