Your goal is to extract high-quality search terms and prepare a metadata-aligned JSON summary for downstream systematic-review tooling.\n- Profile: You design evidence-grounded, reproducible search strategies for literature reviews. You prioritize deduplication, clarity, and coverage.\n- Skills: Systematic review methodology, taxonomy-driven term extraction, boolean query synthesis, deduplication and synonym consolidation, concise rationale writing.\n- Goals: Produce a JSON-only output containing anchor terms, categorized search terms, and per-paper metadata entries (including detected keywords with evidence). Ground every field in the PDFs and the provided metadata.\n- Constraints:\n  - Use only information present in the uploaded PDFs or in the metadata block appended below.\n  - Copy each paper title and abstract exactly as provided; do not paraphrase or truncate them.\n  - Prefer multi-paper-supported terms; mark single-paper terms with lower confidence.\n  - Keep each rationale under 20 words; cite page numbers if available; otherwise use \"page\": \"n/a\".\n  - Keep total recommended search terms <= 50 (default 50).\n  - Keep each search term as a concise noun phrase (ideally 1–2 words, maximum 3); never output full sentences or tokens with underscores.\n  - Output strictly valid JSON, no extra text.\n- Downstream usage (important):\n  - The output anchor_terms and search_terms will be used to construct boolean search queries for arXiv-style engines.\n  - anchor_terms are treated as stable topic anchors; search_terms are category-specific query terms.\n  - Queries are built by combining anchor_terms with search_terms (e.g., (anchor OR anchor OR ...) AND (term OR term OR ...)).\n  - Matching is mostly literal, so anchor_terms and search_terms must be searchable, generalizable phrases (not full titles, not overly specific wording).\n  - Avoid punctuation-heavy strings, quotes, dataset IDs, or long phrases; prefer 1–3 word noun phrases likely to appear in titles/abstracts.\n  - Do not add meta terms like \"survey/review\" unless the topic itself explicitly centers on surveys/reviews.\n- Topic interpretation (important):\n  - The provided topic_hint may be either (1) a broad research area or (2) a specific paper title (possibly exact).\n  - Silently decide which type topic_hint is; do not output the decision.\n  - Never output topic_hint itself as anchor_terms.\n  - If topic_hint is type (2), you must NOT copy the title, subtitle, punctuation, or create abbreviations from it. Derive anchors only from the PDFs/metadata.\n  - If topic_hint is type (1), you may use common field abbreviations only when they appear in the PDFs/metadata and are widely used in the field.\n  - Anchor_terms must appear verbatim (case-insensitive) in the titles/abstracts; use 1–3 word noun phrases without punctuation.\n  - Abbreviations are allowed only if they appear in the PDFs/metadata and are widely used in the field; never invent acronyms.\n  - When an abbreviation is used, include its long-form anchor term alongside it (do not output acronym-only anchors).\n  - Do not inject external domain assumptions; derive anchor_terms from the PDFs/metadata only.\n- Workflow:\n  1) Review the provided paper metadata (see block below) to capture canonical identifiers, titles, abstracts, publication years, and URLs.\n  2) Read the PDFs and identify the central task/topic; propose 2–4 anchor_terms aligned with the metadata guidance.\n  3) For each paper, extract candidate terms grouped by categories: 自行歸納 4–6 個具描述性的 snake_case 分類（例如 benchmarks, training_methods, datasets, evaluation_metrics）.\n     推導多個主題分類，並讓每個分類至少包含 8 個術語（不足 3 個術語時不要獨立成分類），目標總數大約 48 個或依據證據調整\n  - 如果既有分類不足以描述重要議題，可以新增最多兩個新的 snake_case 分類，並提供代表性術語。\n\n  4) Normalize and merge across papers: lemmatize, deduplicate, and consolidate related phrasing for each category.\n  5) Identify supporting evidence for detected keywords (quotes + page numbers when available) so each term can be traced back to the PDFs.\n  6) Keep each `papers[*]` entry aligned with the metadata block; copy titles/abstracts verbatim and supply detected keywords with evidence.\n- Runtime overrides (current request):\n  - topic_hint: discrete audio tokens more than a survey\n  - language: en\n  - include_ethics: false\n  - max_queries: 50\n  - seed_anchors: not provided\n  - custom_categories: not provided (use defaults)\n  - exclude_terms: not provided\n  - anchor_terms: infer 2–4 anchors grounded in the PDFs\n- Provided paper metadata (copy titles/abstracts exactly; keep ordering):\n--- Paper 1 ---\nsource_id: arXiv:2502.06490\ntitle: Recent Advances in Discrete Speech Tokens: A Review\nabstract: The rapid advancement of speech generation technologies in the era of large language models (LLMs) has established discrete speech tokens as a foundational paradigm for speech representation. These tokens, characterized by their discrete, compact, and concise nature, are not only advantageous for efficient transmission and storage, but also inherently compatible with the language modeling framework, enabling seamless integration of speech into text-dominated LLM architectures. Current research categorizes discrete speech tokens into two principal classes: acoustic tokens and semantic tokens, each of which has evolved into a rich research domain characterized by unique design philosophies and methodological approaches. This survey systematically synthesizes the existing taxonomy and recent innovations in discrete speech tokenization, conducts a critical examination of the strengths and limitations of each paradigm, and presents systematic experimental comparisons across token types. Furthermore, we identify persistent challenges in the field and propose potential research directions, aiming to offer actionable insights to inspire future advancements in the development and application of discrete speech tokens.\nyear: 2025\nurl: https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06490v4\npdf_path: /Users/xjp/Desktop/Survey-with-LLMs/Survey-for-survey-review-with-LLMs/AUTOSR-SDSE/workspaces/discrete_audio_tokens_more_than_a_survey/seed/downloads/arxiv/2502.06490.pdf\n- OutputFormat (strict JSON):\n{\n  \"topic\": \"discrete audio tokens more than a survey\",\n  \"anchor_terms\": [\"…\", \"…\"],\n  \"search_terms\": {\n    \"<category>\": [\"…\"],\n    \"<category>\": [\"…\"]\n  },\n  \"papers\": [\n    {\n      \"id\": \"<stable short id>\",\n      \"source_id\": \"arXiv:<identifier>\",\n      \"title\": \"<copy title exactly>\",\n      \"abstract\": \"<copy abstract exactly>\",\n      \"year\": \"<YYYY or unknown>\",\n      \"source_url\": \"<https://arxiv.org/abs/...>\",\n      \"detected_keywords\": [\n        {\n          \"term\": \"…\",\n          \"category\": \"<category label>\",\n          \"evidence\": {\"quote\": \"…\", \"page\": \"n/a|<number>\"},\n          \"confidence\": 0.0\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  ]\n}\n- Example (illustrative only; copy structure, not content):\n```json\n{\n  \"topic\": \"Challenges of Abstractive Dialogue Summarization\",\n  \"anchor_terms\": [\n    \"dialogue summarization\",\n    \"dialog summarization\",\n    \"conversation summarization\"\n  ],\n  \"search_terms\": {\n    \"core_concepts\": [\"technique\", \"dataset\", \"evaluation\"],\n    \"technical_terms\": [\"language model\", \"semantic representation\", \"information extraction\"],\n    \"advanced_concepts\": [\"topic segmentation\", \"personalization\"],\n    \"implementation\": [\"automatic\", \"training\"],\n    \"subdomains\": [\"meeting summarization\", \"customer service summarization\"],\n    \"ethical\": [\"privacy\", \"cost\"]\n  },\n  \"papers\": [\n    {\n      \"id\": \"cads_taxonomy_2025\",\n      \"source_id\": \"arXiv:2501.01234\",\n      \"title\": \"CADS: A Systematic Review of Abstractive Dialogue Summarization\",\n      \"abstract\": \"We categorize 133 dialogue summarization papers published between 2019–2024 across six challenge areas (language, structure, comprehension, speaker, salience, factuality) and map them to techniques, datasets, and metrics.\",\n      \"year\": \"2025\",\n      \"source_url\": \"https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01234\",\n      \"detected_keywords\": [\n        {\n          \"term\": \"language challenge\",\n          \"category\": \"core_concepts\",\n          \"evidence\": {\"quote\": \"We outline the language challenge covering informal dialogue and colloquialisms.\", \"page\": \"n/a\"},\n          \"confidence\": 0.6\n        },\n        {\n          \"term\": \"meeting summarization\",\n          \"category\": \"subdomains\",\n          \"evidence\": {\"quote\": \"The taxonomy highlights datasets for meeting summarization such as AMI and ICSI.\", \"page\": \"n/a\"},\n          \"confidence\": 0.5\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n- Notes:\n  - Keep \"papers\" in the same order as the metadata block.\n  - Do not emit additional top-level keys beyond the schema above.\n\n\nExtracted PDF text (pre-processed):\n\n--- 2502.06490.txt ---\n1\nRecent Advances in Discrete Speech Tokens: A\nReview\nYiwei Guo, Student Member, IEEE, Zhihan Li, Hankun Wang, Bohan Li, Chongtian Shao, Hanglei Zhang,\nChenpeng Du, Xie Chen, Shujie Liu, Kai Yu, Fellow, IEEE\nAbstract—The rapid advancement of speech generation tech-\nnologies in the era of large language models (LLMs) has\nDiscrete\nestablished discrete speech tokens as a foundational paradigm Speech Tokenizer Codec decoder\nfor speech representation.

Note that some codecs in this list are\nalso applicable to general audio. Italic “C,T,U” denote CNN, Transformer or U-Net-based generator architecture. Symbols ‘/’\nand ‘-’ denote “or” and “to” for different model versions, “+” means different configurations in different VQ streams in a\nsingle model, and “≈” means the average value. Q,F,V mean number of quantizers, frame rate and vocabulary size of each\nquantizer respectively. For example, “Q = 2, V=8192+(4096-32768)” in SemantiCodec means one of the two VQ streams\nhas 8192 possible codes, and the other can vary from 4096 to 32768 in different configurations. For FSQ, V is presented\nas Ld where L is the quantization levels for each dimension, and d is the number of dimensions. When L is different for\neach dimension, like LFSC, we use L ×L ×··· to represent each dimension. “Dynamic” means the number for each token\n1 2\nframe is variable, like in variable-bitrate and variable frame rate setups.
