tion and higher variance, and fewer bits to regions with less
uncertainty. This kind of discrete speech tokens is referred to
as variable frame rate (VFR) tokens in this review. Note that
while multi-resolution and variable-bitrate tokens have been
introduced previously, the concept of VFR is still distinct. In
multi-resolution tokens [23], [74], each quantizer operates at
a fixed frame rate. In variable-bitrate tokens [24], the frame
rate remains fixed, while the variability lies in the number
of quantizers per frame. Instead, VFR tokens should directly
allocate different granularities on the temporal axis.
VFRtokensarecloselyrelatedtoacousticunitdiscovery.As
speech lacks a natural boundary of phonetic units [12], there
are much research efforts to find and locate the underlying
acoustic units behind speech utterances in an unsupervised
manner [166]–[169]. This is particularly of interest for low-
resourcelanguages.Thediscoveredunitscanguidethebound-
ary segmentation of VFR tokens. To this end, VFR tokens are
interesting not only because they might reduce the necessary
bitrate, but also because they can introduce a strong inductive
bias that linguistic knowledge is encoded [165].
A recent direction of VFR tokens is to discover acoustic
units from an SSL model. Sylber [170] and SyllableLM [43]
take similar approaches that first heuristically locate acoustic
boundaries from existing HuBERT models, and then train
another HuBERT student with segment-level pooled targets

TABLE II: A summary of widely-used acoustic speech tokens (neural speech codecs). Note that some codecs in this list are
also applicable to general audio. Italic “C,T,U” denote CNN, Transformer or U-Net-based generator architecture. Symbols ‘/’
and ‘-’ denote “or” and “to” for different model versions, “+” means different configurations in different VQ streams in a
single model, and “≈” means the average value. Q,F,V mean number of quantizers, frame rate and vocabulary size of each
quantizer respectively. For example, “Q = 2, V=8192+(4096-32768)” in SemantiCodec means one of the two VQ streams
has 8192 possible codes, and the other can vary from 4096 to 32768 in different configurations. For FSQ, V is presented
as Ld where L is the quantization levels for each dimension, and d is the number of dimensions. When L is different for
each dimension, like LFSC, we use L ×L ×··· to represent each dimension. “Dynamic” means the number for each token
