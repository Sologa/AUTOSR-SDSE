    "exclusion": "Studies that only use continuous audio features (e.g., Mel-spectrogram, MFCC) without any discrete quantization/token design or analysis of discrete tokenization.\nWorks focused on traditional signal-processing codecs (e.g., MP3/Opus-style) without neural encoding/modern quantization-based discrete token representations relevant to language-model-style token sequences.\nEngineering-only reports (e.g., library/tool descriptions) without methodological contribution, systematic analysis, or experimental validation related to discrete audio tokens.\nStudies where audio is merely a data modality while the core tokenization contribution is for text or images, and the work does not analyze discrete audio representations themselves.\nTokenization methods for non-speech audio only (e.g., music/environmental sound) when the study does not make its discrete token approach applicable to speech tasks or does not evaluate speech-relevant implications."

      "title": "Personalized Acoustic Modeling by Weakly Supervised Multi-Task Deep Learning using Acoustic Tokens Discovered from Unlabeled Data",
      "abstract": "It is well known that recognizers personalized to each user are much more effective than user-independent recognizers. With the popularity of smartphones today, although it is not difficult to collect a large set of audio data for each user, it is difficult to transcribe it. However, it is now possible to automatically discover acoustic tokens from unlabeled personal data in an unsupervised way. We therefore propose a multi-task deep learning framework called a phoneme-token deep neural network (PTDNN), jointly trained from unsupervised acoustic tokens discovered from unlabeled data and very limited transcribed data for personalized acoustic modeling. We term this scenario \"weakly supervised\". The underlying intuition is that the high degree of similarity between the HMM states of acoustic token models and phoneme models may help them learn from each other in this multi-task learning framework. Initial experiments performed over a personalized audio data set recorded from Facebook posts demonstrated that very good improvements can be achieved in both frame accuracy and word accuracy over popularly-considered baselines such as fDLR, speaker code and lightly supervised adaptation. This approach complements existing speaker adaptation approaches and can be used jointly with such techniques to yield improved results.",
